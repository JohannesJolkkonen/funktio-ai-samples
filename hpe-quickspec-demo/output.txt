HPE Flexible Slot (Flex Slot) Power Supplies share a common electrical and physical design that allows for hot
plug, tool-less installation into HPE ProLiant Gen11 Performance Servers. Flex Slot power supplies are
certified for high-efficiency operation and offer multiple power output options, allowing users to "right-size" a
power supply for specific server configurations. This flexibility helps to reduce power waste, lower overall
energy costs, and avoid "trapped" power capacity in the data center.  
The standard 6-foot IEC C-13/C-14 jumper cord (A0K02A) is included with each standard AC power supply

\ Smart Templates from HPE
HPE is releasing new Smart Template technology in the One Config Advanced (OCA) configurator. These
Templates represent the CTO equivalents of the top-selling BTO configurations. They are intended to
provide simple starting points to assist you in easily creating and customizing your desired Server
solutions.   HPE Servers that have Platform Templates, developed by HPE Product Managers, will have a
separate tab in the HPE OCA configurator.  
Workload Solutions Templates from HPE
The Workload Solutions Templates build on the Smart Templates technology to easily develop working
configurations of the most compelling Workload Solutions. The templates complement the Reference
Builds developed by HPE. Workload Solutions templates preconfigure some of the key architecture
decisions and make it easier for Sellers to get started and complete a differentiated server solution for your
customer's specific workload.  
Mainstream SKUs
HPE launched the Mainstream SKU initiative as a market-driven approach to Demand Steering. It is a
simplified portfolio of our top selling options that meet the current and future market trends. HPE has
committed to provide a more predictable and faster experience for these options.   Mainstream SKUs enjoy
higher safety stock levels and have higher fulfilment service levels than non-Mainstream SKUs. Mainstream
orders are fulfilled +30% faster than non-Mainstream orders, have fewer shortages and better recovery
dates.  This platform has Mainstream SKUs in the options portfolio, and is eligible for the improved
Mainstream experience.   Mainstream SKUs are designated with a Mainstream symbol in our configurators.  
Mainstream Configurations
HPE is using the new Smart Templates technology to present Mainstream configurations.   All the options in
a Mainstream configuration are pre-selected Mainstream SKUs to optimize the performance, predictability
and fulfilment experience. Check the Template section in our configurators for eligible Mainstream
configurations.
 
This section lists some of the steps required to configure a Factory Integrated Model. To ensure only valid
configurations are ordered,  Hewlett Packard Enterprise recommends the use of an HPE approved
configurator. Contact your local sales representative for information on configurable product offerings and
requirements.
Factory Integrated Models must start with a CTO Server.
FIO indicates that this option is only available as a factory installable option.
All Factory Integrated Models will be populated with sufficient hard drive blanks based on the number
of initial hard drives ordered with the server.
Some options may not be integrated at the factory. Contact your local sales representative for
additional information.
Step 1: Base Configuration  (choose one (1) of the following four (4) configurable server models from
the tables below)
The below (4) CTO server models, denoted with "NC" in the SKU description, provide flexibility in the
networking choice and require a network adapter from the "HPE Networking" section be selected.

− HPE Trusted Supply Chain (P36394-B21) is an optional security upgrade intended for agencies and
regulated industries needing enhanced security and compliance needs. Applying this option to a DL380
Gen11 CTO server ensures it is built in the USA in a secured facility by vetted HPE personnel assigned
to the manufacturing processes. A multitude of checkpoints/inspections for malicious microcode and
counterfeit parts are performed throughout the server build, and additional safeguards are put in place
against cyber-exploits throughout the server lifecycle. The HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen11 is re-branded as
a HPE ProLiant DL380T Gen11 to denote the HPE Trusted Supply Chain security enhancements. The
DL380T is Trade Agreement Act (TAA) compliant. See "HPE Security" section within this document for
more detail and learn more at http://www.hpe.com/security
− *HPE offers multiple Trade Agreement Act (TAA) compliant configurations to meet the needs of US
Federal Government customers. These products are either manufactured or substantially transformed in
a designated country.  TAA compliance is only provided when HPE options are included as part of
factory integrated orders (CTO).
− All CTO servers are Energy Star 3.0 compliant.

Notes:
− HPE Server Memory compatibility for a specific server platform may vary or be limited within a server
platform depending upon the specific configuration being requested.  Because each server environment
and requirements can vary, memory compatibility is based not only upon the server family, but may also
be affected by the amount and type of additional hardware options installed within a specific server
configuration.  For this reason, some HPE memory DIMMs may be qualified for an HPE server model or
family and yet occasionally not be supported with some configurations within that server family
− Memory should be installed in even quantity of DIMMs
− The maximum memory speed and capacity is a function of the memory type, memory configuration, and
processor model.
− DDR5-4800 Memory Kits are only supported with 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Series Processors.
− Memory compatibility may vary or be limited within a specific server family depending upon the specific
configuration being requested.  Because each server environment and requirements can vary, memory
compatibility is based not only upon the server family, but may also be affected by the amount and type
of additional hardware options installed within a specific server configuration.  For this reason, some
HPE memory DIMMs may be qualified for a server model or family and yet occasionally not be
supported with limited configurations within that server family.
− Please consult with the HPE server Quickspecs or your HPE representative if you have any questions
regarding memory compatibility with a specific HPE server configuration.

Memory Selection
To streamline the configuration process for HPE ProLiant Gen11 servers and to provide the best product
availability, HPE recommends memory from the list located here:
http://www.hpe.com/products/recommend .
Best product availability is limited to US, Canada, and Latin America at this time.
Notes:
− HPE Server Memory compatibility for a specific server platform may vary or be limited within a server
platform depending upon the specific configuration being requested.  Because each server environment
and requirements can vary, memory compatibility is based not only upon the server family, but may also
be affected by the amount and type of additional hardware options installed within a specific server
configuration.  For this reason, some HPE memory DIMMs may be qualified for an HPE server model or
family and yet occasionally not be supported with some configurations within that server family
− Maximum memory capacity and speed per processor is dependent on processor model selection or
limitation.

HPE Trusted Supply Chain for HPE ProLiant P36394-B21
Notes:
− HPE Trusted Supply Chain (P36394-B21) is an optional security upgrade intended for
agencies and regulated industries needing enhanced security and compliance needs.
Applying this option to a DL380 Gen11 CTO server ensures it is built in the USA in a secured
facility by vetted HPE personnel assigned to the manufacturing processes. A multitude of
checkpoints/inspections for malicious microcode and counterfeit parts are performed
throughout the server build, and additional safeguards are put in place against cyber-exploits
throughout the server lifecycle. The HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen11 is re-branded as a HPE
ProLiant DL380T Gen11 to denote the HPE Trusted Supply Chain security enhancements.
The DL380T Gen11 is Trade Agreement Act (TAA) compliant.Learn more at

Notes:
− Ommited DIMM counts/socket not qualified by Intel.
− 1 Supports SGX (Software Guard Extensions)
− 2 Support Hemi (hemisphere mode).
 
General Memory Population Rules and Guidelines :
DIMMs should be installed in quantities of even numbers.
Install DIMMs only if the corresponding processor is installed.
If only one processor is installed in a two-processor system, only half of the DIMM slots are available.
To maximize performance, it is recommended to balance the total memory capacity between all installed
processors.
When two processors are installed, balance the DIMMs across the two processors.
White DIMM slots denote the first slot to be populated in a channel.
Mixing of DIMM types (UDIMM, RDIMM, and LRDIMM) is not supported.
Mixing of x4 and x8 memory is not allowed.
The maximum memory speed is a function of the memory type, memory configuration, and processor
model.
The maximum memory capacity is a function of the number of DIMM slots on the platform, the largest
DIMM capacity qualified on the platform, and the number and model of installed processors qualified on
the platform.

Notes:
− The declared mean A-weighted sound power level, LwA,m, is computed as the arithmetic average of the
measured.
− A-weighted sound power levels for a randomly selected sample, rounded to the nearest 0,1 B.
− The declared mean A-weighted emission sound pressure level, LpA,m, is computed as the arithmetic
average of the measured A-weighted emission sound pressure levels at the bystander positions for a
randomly selected sample, rounded to the nearest 1 dB.
− The statistical adder for verification, Kv, is a quantity to be added to the declared mean A-weighted sound
power level, LwA,m, such that there will be a 95 % probability of acceptance, when using the verification
procedures of ISO 9296, if no more than 6,5 % of the batch of new equipment, has A-weighted sound
power levels greater than (LwA,m + Kv).
− The quantity, LwA,c (formerly called LwAd), can be computed from the sum of LWA,m and Kv.
− All measurements made to conform to ISO 7779 / ECMA-74 and declared to conform to ISO 9296 /
ECMA-109.
− B, dB, abbreviations for bels and decibels, respectively, where 1 B = 10 dB.
− The results in this declaration apply only to the model numbers listed above when operating and tested
according to the indicated modes and standards. A system with additional configuration components or
increased operating functionality may increase the noise emission values.
− System under abnormal conditions may increase the noise level, persons in the vicinity of the product
[cabinet] for extended periods of time should consider wearing hearing protection or using other means
to reduce noise exposure.
