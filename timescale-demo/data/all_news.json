        "body": "DRIVERS are in the mood for a vehicle re-vamp after a TikToker showed them how their car can look brand new in just a few hours.\n\nWhile many people start spring cleaning their homes, TikTok users have been reminded not to forget their cars.\n\nNatalie Steinman (@nataliesteinman) showcased how she gets her vehicle looking brand new with some elbow grease, easy changes, and a little-known children's toy that doubles as a cleaning product.\n\n\"Let the spring cleaning comments,\" Steinman told viewers in the caption of the video.\n\nSteinman focuses entirely on the interior of her car and starts by filling a trash bag full of receipts, empty bottles, and food wrappers.\n\nShe then removes the mats which she later cleans with soap and water and scrubs with a toilet brush.\n\nUsing a car hoover she then removes any crumbs and dirt from her Ford's carpets and storage areas.\n\nThe TikToker then showed off the most ingenious cleaning hack using a children's toy that can be bought at Walmart for less than $5.\n\nWhen it comes to cleaning cars, all drivers know the problem of getting dirt and dust out of various hard-to-reach areas like air vents.\n\nHowever, by using Silly Putty, Steinman can easily mold the slime into these problem areas.\n\nThis then picks up the dirt and removes it without leaving a mark.\n\nThe TikToker can be seen wiping the slime over her navigation and central console as well as the gear shift and inside cup holders.\n\nShe then uses wipes and screen cleaner to finish it all off, not forgetting the leather seats.\n\nOnce the mats are washed and have been dried with a leaf blower, they are placed back inside the vehicle and she adds a stylish car trash bag to the back and storage boxes in the trunk.\n\nFor moms and female drivers, the TikToker reminded them that a bag of essentials is always useful to keep in the car.\n\nSteinman fills a small cosmetics bag with tampons, lip gloss, Advil, perfume, and mascara which she then places on the armrest next to the driver.\n\nOther items that may be useful to store in the vehicle include tissues, wipes, small snacks, band-aids, a phone charger, and sanitary pads.\n\nAfter some hard work, Steinman rewarded herself with a new key cover for her fob which was the final touch to make the car look and feel brand new.\n\n\"Giving me the motivation,\" one viewer commented as others fell in love with the key cover from Amazon.\n\nOne tip includes how to do the Japanese door trick which does not involve any additional items but effectively displaces hot air and cools the interior.",

        "title": "How media buyers view the retail media landscape  --  from Amazon to Walmart to Wawa",
        "body": "The promise of wealth, or in this case, ad dollars, has the marketplace heating up with scads of retailers, from first-movers like Amazon to newcomers like Wawa convenience store -- even to the unsuspected like Cars.com automotive company.\n\nBy the end of this year, retail media ad spend is expected to make up one-fifth of worldwide digital ad spend, scooping up $140 billion, which is up from the forecasted $115 billion in 2023, according to eMarketer.\n\nRetail media is a growing space, no doubt. Especially as advertisers are eager to plug the holes Google's third-party cookie deprecation is leaving behind. But that growth has led to fragmentation as agencies grapple with where to spend client ad dollars that'll give the most bang for their buck.\n\n\"From where we sit as an agency, it's certainly making our lives and our day-to-day work more exciting, more challenging,\" said Ethan Goodman, evp of digital commerce at The Mars Agency.\n\nIn regards to the biggest players in the space, like Amazon Ads, Roundel (Target's retail media business), Walmart Connect and Albertsons Media Collective, he said, \"They have significantly improved and scaled their capabilities -- their audience and targeting capabilities, their measurement capabilities. Really practically, they've improved their channel offering and the breadth of their channel capabilities.\"\n\nDigiday caught up with Goodman and other agency executives to talk about how the retail media competition is looking -- and the players most on their radar.\n\nAmazon Advertising launched in 2012, giving it a first-mover advantage in the space and making it almost synonymous with the concept of retail media. This year, Amazon is expected to hoover up 74% of the nearly $60 billion in U.S. digital retail media ad spend, according to eMarketer's forecasts. Given its pure scale, Amazon could stand as an unexpected beneficiary of Google Chrome's third-party cookie fallout once the dust settles.\n\nAs its business matures, the mammoth-sized company has made recent ad tech and artificial intelligence upgrades to enhance its offering as well as new inventory, selling ads on Prime Video to advertisers. This layers on top of its self-service ad solution through its owned streaming services like Freevee, Twitch and Thursday Night Football, and in-store advertising through Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh, making it a top contender for ad dollars.\n\n\"A lot of our brand national dollars are spent across Amazon,\" said an agency executive who spoke with Digiday and requested anonymity. The exec did not disclose spend figures. \"As CPG becomes more important for Amazon and grocery becomes a bigger deal for them, whether that's through Whole Foods or Amazon Fresh or other places, we're going to see our CPG spend continue to increase.\"\n\nBeyond its sheer size (it touts an audience of more than 150 million), Amazon's ad business is an ecosystem with data from Amazon DSP, Amazon Ads APIs and Amazon Marketing Cloud, offering marketers more granular audience insights. Amazon also opened its platform to developers and plug-ins for things like dashboards or other tools.\n\n\"They're able to do closed loop attribution, whereby the performance of an impression served on Amazon Prime can be tracked back to what it ultimately helps drive at the Amazon.com level,\" said Harry Inglis, head of activation at Media by Mother, Mother's three-year-old media agency. \"It's hard to compete with.\"\n\nAnother early entrant to the retail media competition, Walmart Connect, has moved recently to close the gap between it and Amazon. In February, Walmart announced plans to acquire smart TV manufacturer Vizio for $2.3 billion, bolstering its retail media offering by adding more streaming capabilities. In January, it set its sights on a TikTok integration, offering advertisers sales measurement data and access to the coveted Gen Z audience. Both of these events build on its partnership with Roku, announced in 2022, to bring shoppable ads to streaming. And it helps that Walmart has a massive physical presence with more than 4,600 locations in the U.S., shadowing Amazon's 500 Whole Foods Markets.\n\nHaving launched back in 2017, Walmart Connect has spent the last year-and-a-half beefing up its advertising capabilities, including the Walmart Connect Academy Ad Certification program to educate agencies and brands on what it can do. Its latest move with Vizio, and now integration with TikTok, is intended to reach advertisers' latest fascination: streaming and digital video.\n\n\"The more that they're moving those digital solutions in-store, I think will be some of the growth,\" the anonymous agency exec told Digiday. \"[RMNs] already made partnerships and social, which was smart because that's where people are spending a lot of their time. And then, now where? Now, it's streaming?\"\n\nSpending on platforms outside of Amazon, like Walmart, Target and the like, is seeing double-digit growth this year. Notably, Walmart appears to be at the helm of said growth spurt, according to previous Digiday reporting.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission's decision to block the Kroger-Albertsons merger last month may have put a wrench in growth plans, but Albertsons Media Collective is still one of the top contenders for retail media network spend -- a tertiary challenger, behind the likes of Amazon, Walmart, Target and of course, Kroger, agency execs say.\n\nIt only launched back in 2022, but has sparked advertisers' interest, noted as a more ambitious player in the space, listening to both needs and wants in the marketplace, per agency execs. Last January, Albertsons became the first advertiser to use LiveRamp and Pinterest's clean room offering to tie offline sales to online behavior.\n\nBut perhaps most notably, the grocery chain has started aiming to tackle standardization and measurement issues, a pain point in an increasingly crowded and fragmented marketplace. And that's what sets it apart, per agency execs.\n\n\"Albertsons actually came out publicly and are talking all about measurement and standardization,\" said a second agency exec who wished to remain anonymous. \"They're really trying to set the standards, be the retailer that's leaning into these standards.\"\n\nIn a sea of retail media networks, agency executives highlighted The Home Depot's unique data as a keen proposition to advertisers. The retailer offers on-site and off-site ad placements and is able to create audiences around specific groups, including people who have recently moved, those who are redecorating, or setting up a business or any other life event. Each of these data points can win over a range of advertisers, whether it be internet providers or insurance companies.\n\nThe niche nature of The Home Depot, which launched its offering in 2019, gives it a competitive edge for some executives. Instead of identifiers like demographics or psychographic data, The Home Depot builds audiences based on home projects shoppers are doing -- a data point not easily found within the retail media space, especially at that scale. Notably, the company has more than 2,300 stores across North America.\n\n\"Home Depot, they actually have something unique in the sense of they created the retail media plus network,\" said the second agency exec. \"From that capacity, they are trying to not only sell media to their suppliers, but ask their suppliers what they want.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with Digiday, Melanie Babcock, vp of Retail Media+ and monetization at The Home Depot, said the company is looking to expand beyond endemic advertisers.\n\nInstacart exploded during the pandemic lockdown, when shoppers turned to the delivery service to shop at grocery stores and convenience stores without leaving the comfort of their home.\n\nIn a post-Covid world, agency execs wondered if Instacart would continue to thrive and if it would gobble up ad dollars via its retail media network, which launched in 2022.\n\n\"We were questioning whether it was true incrementality because a lot of what they were delivering was retailers that we already had agreements with. They were just the delivery platform at the time,\" said the first agency executive. Thus far, they said, it's held up.\n\nThis year, the company started looking at off-site retail media, pitching advertisers on Google Shopping ads, which are enhanced by its own retail media data. As Retail Dive recently reported in January, early advertisers for the move include Danone's Oikos and Kraft Heinz's Kraft.\n\nThat partnership has sparked advertisers' interest as the company's retail partners are making placements available on their shopping cart, an interesting proposition for consumer packaged goods brands, the exec said.\n\nOther off-site efforts include a partnership with Roku last April, and ad targeting on Sprouts Farmers Market last May.\n\nWith seven years in the retail media network game, Kroger Precision Marketing (KPM) has made a name for itself, partnering with the likes of Cooler Screens, Meta, Pinterest, Roku, Snap, The Trade Desk and others.\n\nLike Albertsons, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's decision to block the Kroger-Albertsons merger may have put a damper on growth. But with recent innovations, growth is expected to continue. The retailer has been steadily growing its ad offering, with efforts to marry online and offline sales data dating back to 2020.\n\nLast November, KPM announced new programmatic capabilities with The Trade Desk. Last June, Kroger took its self-service ad platform in-house, giving advertisers access to the grocer's product listing ads as well as display advertising.\n\n\"Kroger is one of the top offerings in the U.S.,\" said the second agency executive. \"We think the best data offerings to date. However, they are extremely conservative when it comes to making any type of decisions (innovations, legal, negotiations etc.).\" Again, this is in comparison to retailers like Albertsons, which the agency exec says is more ambitious when it comes to responding to an ever-changing marketplace.\n\nKroger may have more red tape, but it has spent the last year-and-a-half shifting to a \"mindset of collaboration,\" according to the first agency executive. The retailer has also started to focus on things like standardization and measurement. All in all, Kroger is considered a top partner for the agency, who said Kroger's offering is on par with Walmart.\n\nTarget has been aiming to build a media business to rival Amazon since rebranding as Roundel in 2019. Seemingly, it's making good on its promise, coming in at marketers' third most-used retail media network, according to Digiday research, behind Amazon and Walmart.\n\nLast October, Target announced that it was enhancing its Roundel retail media business with Roundel Media Studio, a self-service buying tool, premium programmatic publisher partners and experimenting with shoppable connected TV. Roundel has recently been focused on expanding both its onsite and offsite inventory, including new ad formats like shoppable CTV, according to The Mars Agency's Retail Media Report Card, a quarterly assessment and comparison retail media platform comparison tool.\n\nIt all makes a compelling argument as far as advertisers are concerned. Meaning Roundel is considered one of the leaders in the retail media landscape, given the retailer's capabilities around audiences, channels and measurement. \"They are also notably ahead of the game when it comes to taking an integrated approach to media and merchandising, and creating both seamless omnichannel experiences for Target guests and holistic, added-value opportunities for brands/advertisers,\" said a third agency exec, who spoke anonymously.\n\nWawa convenience store is the latest to throw its hat in the ring as a retail media network competitor. While having only launched weeks ago, agency executives say clients are already interested in its offerings, especially in its fuel pump screen inventory.\n\nThe convenience store partnered with Publicis Groupe's Publicis Sapient, Epsilon, and CitrusAd for its offering, with custom ads and campaigns on digital channels like Wawa's websites, mobile app or video ads at a Wawa pump -- a selling point for advertisers looking for more ways to get in front of shoppers.\n\n\"In addition to allowing brands to reach their shoppers on their website and inside their mobile app, they're also making some of their gas station screen inventory available,\" said Goodman. \"Some of those unique inventory opportunities are again, a potential point of differentiation for players like that.\"\n\nOther selling points are Wawa's audience, which could be unique given it has a cult-like following, and its ability to close the loop from customers seeing an ad at the pump before going into the convenience store to make a purchase. Given, the convenience store chain is smaller with about 1,000 locations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Florida. This year, the convenience store opened its first Georgia location.\n\n\"For a challenger like Wawa to go out to the brand marketplace and say, 'I can uniquely reach this audience segment that you can't reach through another retail media network,' is a potential way in and is an advantage for them for sure,\" per Goodman.",

        "body": "Loading...Loading...\n\nIn a recent segment of CNBC's \"Mad Money,\" renowned market commentator Jim Cramer expressed his support for Shopify Inc. SHOP, positioning the company as a strong player in the e-commerce industry along with rival Jeff Bezos' Amazon.\n\nWhat Happened: On Wednesday, Cramer gave a nod of approval to Shopify during the Lighting Round segment of CNBC, emphasizing its strong performance with small and medium-sized businesses and comparing it with Amazon.\n\n\"I like e-commerce. I like Amazon more than Shopify, but I think Shopify does an absolutely terrific job with small, medium-sized businesses, consumer packaged goods companies. I would stick by it.\"\n\nSee Also: Whopping $33.8 Million Worth Of Dogecoin Shifted To Robinhood -- And People Suspect This Person Could Be Behind It\n\nWhy It Matters: Cramer's endorsement comes at a pivotal time for Shopify, following a tumultuous period where the company's stock experienced a sharp decline after its Q4 performance. Despite surpassing revenue expectations with a 24% year-over-year increase to $2.14 billion, the stock took a hit, which may have been due to concerns over future growth prospects.\n\nAdditionally, before the earnings release, there was a sense of caution among analysts regarding Shopify's valuation. An analyst report highlighted the challenges in justifying the stock's valuation, suggesting that caution may be warranted.\n\nPrice Action: As of the latest trading session, Shopify saw its stock price close at $81.33, marking a 4.90% increase from the previous close, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Top 4 Tech Stocks That May Collapse In March\n\nPhoto by Koshiro K on Shutterstock\n\nEngineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Pooja Rajkumari\n\nThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

I've always had dark circles under my eyes and I've tried so many concealers and nothing has ever hidden them.. well until today! I honestly can't believe how well this product works. I don't have any dark circles!! I love this product so much already.\"\n\nA second customer, praising it 'the best brightening concealer out there' added: \"I'm a bit of a makeup geek and I've tried so many concealers, from high end to the high street and this is one I ALWAYS come back to! It's amazing - brightens any areas of discolouration and dark under eyes, hides eye bags as if by magic and covers up any spots and pimples perfectly.\"\n\n\"They might have nailed it,\" another agreed. \"I think I pretty much love everything about this concealer from the colour matching, to the coverage, all the way to the time it lasts and even the applicator. This + mineral powder = my daily face coverage routine completed within a minute.\"\n\nAnd it's not just Amazon who makes a tonne of sales off the back of this product, as it's been said the beauty must-have leaves stores every nine seconds in the UK. You can pick up my beauty saviour here for \u00a32.50 now.\n\nWhile it's significantly more, another product which has been praised for its ability to cover up dark circles and blemishes is Rodial's Banana Low Lighter, priced at \u00a338.\n\nThe creamy formula glides effortlessly across the skin, avoiding the risk of sinking into pores or fine lines while the light coverage minimises dark circles and blemishes, encouraging a fully-rested appearance.",

        "body": "Meta, Microsoft, Match Group and X have thrown their hats in with Epic Games and claim Apple has made it difficult for app developers to move customers to alternative payments methods on the App Store.\n\nEpic Games seems to have gained some allies in its ongoing disputes with Apple, as several Big Tech companies have called out the iPhone maker for its app payment rules.\n\nMeta, Microsoft, Match Group and X have all weighed in with an amicus brief, supporting a claim from Epic Games that Apple failed to honour a court-ordered injunction in 2021. This injunction was meant to stop Apple from preventing app developers from using \"buttons, external links, or other calls to action\" informing users of payment options outside of their apps.\n\nThe companies that filed the amicus brief claim they have all dealt with methods from Apple that aim to prevent them from moving users away from Apple's own payment processing system. They claim that Apple is in violation of the 2021 injunction as it has made it difficult to move customers to cheaper ways to pay for content.\n\nThe companies claim that Apple's new process to allow developers to share an \"out-of-app purchase mechanism\" includes s \"dozens of requirements and limitations to which developers must adhere to\" to be eligible to include an external link in their apps.\n\n\"The Apple plan leaves in place anti-steering rules that this court expressly found to be anti-competitive and imposes new restrictions on app developers that ensure the price competition that the injunction was designed to promote will never materialise,\" the amicus brief reads.\n\nThe move by these Big Tech companies follows a legal push by Epic Game last week. The gaming company demanded that Apple be held in contempt of the earlier court order and that it was conducting \"sham\" compliance.\n\nEpic Games has been in legal battles with Apple for years, criticising the tech giant for how it handles its App Store.\n\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has also been an outspoken critics of Apple's attempts to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act. In January, he said that proposals made by the company to comply with the EU rules were \"a devious new instance of malicious compliance\".\n\nEpic is not alone in its criticism. An open letter signed by 34 organisations - including Epic, Spotify and the president of Microsoft's Xbox business - was sent to the European Commission last week, stating various concerns about Apple's proposed measures to comply with the DMA.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

        "body": "Meta, Microsoft, X and online dating giant Match Group hit at Apple on Wednesday for overcharging on app purchases.\n\nThe four companies filed a rare joint amicus brief in a California court in charge of applying a ruling that Apple must allow companies to link to alternative payment options outside the app store for iPhone users.\n\nThat ruling was stemmed from a 2020 lawsuit by video gaming giant Epic Games, which has been fighting Apple in courts across the globe for years over its strict app store policies.\n\nApple takes a cut of as much as 30 percent on all financial transactions in its app shop, prompting complaints about an unfair \"tax\" on companies.\n\nA federal court in San Francisco overwhelmingly rejected Epic's lawsuit in 2021, offering only a concession that apps could indicate other ways of paying for services outside of Apple's ecosystem.\n\nBut Apple's compliance with the order earlier this year drew a furious response from Epic, which went to court arguing that it was defying the judge's intentions.\n\nApple's proposed solution allows it a 12 to 27 percent fee on external purchases outside its app store, which amounts to just a small discount from what it charged within the app store.\n\n\"The Apple Plan comports with neither the letter nor the spirit of this Court's mandate,\" Meta, Microsoft, X and Match said in their joint filing on Wednesday, in support of Epic.\n\nThe plan's \"new restrictions are plainly designed to render alternatives to Apple's in-app purchases impractical for developers, and inaccessible and unappealing to consumers,\" they added.\n\nApple told AFP that it has \"fully complied with the injunction,\" of the judge, which allows it to take measures needed to protect users.\n\nThese measures also \"guard against the uncompensated use of, among other things, Apple's platform, services... and proprietary tools and technologies protected by intellectual property,\" the company said, quoting its compliance statement sent to the court.",

        "body": "(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway has increased its pace of repurchasing its own shares, a sign that longtime Chairman Warren Buffett considers them undervalued and a good place to spend excess cash.\n\nIn its proxy filing on Friday, Berkshire said it repurchased the equivalent of 3,808 Class A shares this year through March 6, spending approximately $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion depending on the dates of the buybacks.\n\nNearly three-quarters of the repurchases took place after Feb. 12.\n\nBerkshire repurchased $2.2 billion of its own stock in last year's fourth quarter, and $9.2 billion in all of 2023.\n\nIts peak year for buybacks was 2021, when they totaled $27 billion.\n\nBuffett, 93, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire since 1965, and oversees buybacks and other major capital allocation decisions.\n\nRepurchases help Buffett deploy some of the conglomerate's cash and equivalents, which totaled $167.6 billion at year end.\n\nBerkshire has said it will maintain a $30 billion cash cushion, and that \"financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance.\"\n\nThrough Friday, Berkshire's share price was up 14% this year, about twice the gain for the Standard & Poor's 500.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy)",

        "body": "Loading...Loading...\n\nDeepwater Asset Management's managing partner Gene Munster has echoed the views of Dan Nathan from RiskRevarsal Advisors, saying that Apple Inc. AAPL and Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL are underdogs in the artificial intelligence arena.\n\nWhat Happened: On Thursday, Munster took to X, formerly Twitter, and shared his conversation with Nathan on a podcast saying, \"Dan Nathan said it well, $GOOG and $AAPL are the AI underdogs. I believe that will change.\"\n\nSee Also: Gene Munster Says US Government Likely To Block Top AI Firms From Foreign Funding Over National Security, Calls AI 'The Next Arms Race'\n\nOn the podcast, the duo spoke about multiple subjects including ongoing TikTok debacle, Nvidia Corporation and the reported partnership discussions between Apple and Google regarding integrating the latter's AI model Gemini to power the new iPhone software features.\n\nAt one point, Nathan said that if these two Magnificent 7 companies tie up, it would be \"fascinating,\" as it would get a \"good narrative going.\"\n\n\"It would be amazing that these two companies would be the underdogs ... that is the thing, and then when you see Jensen Wang walk out at the SAP Center yesterday to 10,000 adoring fans. Apple can't even do live events anymore for things like Vision Pro because there's just no excitement around their product,\" Nathan said, to which Munster largely agreed.\n\nNathan added, \"I think we're going to look back on this period and we're gonna have some really interesting -- whether it's waves, whether it's paradigm shifts, whatever. I think we're going to look back in the last 12 months and there's going to be, you know, a lot to debate.\"\n\nWhy It's Important: Earlier this week, Mark Gurman reported that Apple was in similar discussions with both Google and ChatGPT-parent OpenAI, to license their AI models.\n\nApple's reported discussion with Google has not been received well by some analysts. Previously, Tesla investor Ross Gerber criticized this reported deal calling it a \"sad admission\" of missed opportunities.\n\nBillionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya also thinks that this reported decision mirrors Cupertino's approach toward electric cars, as it was previously reported that Apple decided to retreat from the automotive sector.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Koshiro K On Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Gene Munster Predicts 'Boat Loads' Of Funding For Elon Musk's xAI After It Open Sources Grok: 'Many Will See This As A Swing At OpenAI'\n\nLoading...Loading...",

The warehouse workers are seeking a fair wage progression, lower health care costs, and stronger seniority rights.\n\n\"All we want is a fair deal that improves our workplace, addresses our health care concerns, and fixes our outdated wage progression,\" said Chris Simpkins, a 33-year warehouse worker at AmerisourceBergen. \"This used to be a good place to work, but corporate greed has taken over and the company has lost its way. We perform an important job that people depend on, and we deserve more.\"\n\nWith a current starting rate of $16.50 an hour and a six-year wage progression topping out at $26 an hour. AmerisourceBergen is also attempting to take away 16 hours of paid vacation time to offset the cost of the additional 16 hours of paid sick leave mandated under Senate Bill 616, which went into effect Jan. 15.\n\nWorkers are also striking over the high costs for health insurance, with the average worker paying 25 percent of the monthly health insurance premiums, which can result in more than $6,000 per year, in addition to out-of-pocket expenses and copays.\n\nRead more: https://www.publicnow.com/view/DCF6FA0BB58980100BC1A230003388275D16EED2",

        "title": "4 Reasons to Remain Bullish on Costco Wholesale Stock This Year",
        "body": "Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) is trading at close to 50 times its trailing earnings. Although not near its 52-week high anymore, the stock still looks expensive given its level of profitability. During the past 12 months, Costco shares surged 50%, soaring past the S&P 500 and its 32% gains over that time frame.\n\nBut despite its high price tag, there are still many reasons for investors to remain bullish on the stock both for this year and the long haul. Here's why Costco stock can be a great buy, even at its seemingly high valuation.\n\n1. The business is still showing strong member growth\n\nRevenue growth is important for businesses, but for Costco, membership growth may be even more crucial. Those are the customers who are signing up for one of its memberships and who are planning to spend at its warehouses on a regular basis. And with a high renewal rate, normally around 90% or better, odds are any new members are going to be customers for a long time.\n\nOn the company's most recent earnings call, which was for the fiscal second quarter (ended Feb. 18), management said the number of paid household memberships rose by 7.8% year over year. Costco now has 73.4 million paid household members and 132 million cardholders. It's an encouraging sign that even amid inflation and as budgets tighten up, consumers are seeing enough value in Costco's membership to sign up. That bodes well for the company's growth prospects this year and beyond.\n\n2. Gross margin improved\n\nCostco's business has proven resilient, yet again, as the company's gross margin was well protected. Last quarter, the company reported that its gross profit margin was up by 8 basis points compared to a year earlier. And even when factoring out gas deflation, gross margin was still higher by 4 basis points.\n\nWhile those aren't huge improvements in the grand scheme of things (10.8% versus 10.72%), for retailers with thin margins and where cost control is crucial, this too is an encouraging sign that the company should be able to grow its profits. As its member count increases and the company isn't having to sacrifice gross margin for the sake of growth, Costco's bottom line should continue to increase, which means that a high price-to-earnings multiple could come down in the future.\n\n3. Costco is opening more stores\n\nIn the current fiscal year, Costco expects to open 30 new stores, with two being relocations. While many of its new locations will be in the U.S., Costco is also launching new stores in Asia, including Japan, Korea, and China. The company said there were 10,000 people at the opening of its sixth store in China.\n\nThe strong demand in China is an exciting indicator of the long-term potential Costco has in that market. With just six stores, China is an almost untapped market for the big-box retailer. Costco still has plenty of growth opportunities in the long run, which is what makes it an incredibly attractive long-term buy.\n\n4. The e-commerce business is another big opportunity for Costco\n\nIn Q2, Costco reported 5.6% comparable sales growth. But what really stood out was e-commerce, where comparable sales were up 18.4% year over year. E-commerce is another area where Costco is just scratching the surface in terms of potential, as is evident with that much faster growth rate. The company also says it recently rolled out Apple Pay as a payment option online to all of its members, which can facilitate the buying process and appeal to a wider range of customers.\n\nCostco stock may be expensive, but it can still make for a solid investment\n\nCostco's stock comes at a premium but odds are, this isn't going to be a stock that trades at 20 times earnings anytime soon. The danger for long-term investors is that if you wait too long for it to come down significantly in value, you might miss out on gains. If you're looking for a growth stock to buy and hold for the long haul, Costco can be a terrific investment to add to your portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Costco Wholesale wasn't one of them.

Read on to find out why and which stocks to consider.\n\nDividend Stocks And The S&P 500\n\nThe S&P 500 is a financial market index that includes 500 top-performing, U.S. public companies. The index is widely referenced as a benchmark for large-cap U.S. stocks. It also accounts for about 80% of U.S. market capitalization.\n\nStocks are selected for inclusion in the S&P 500 based on size, liquidity, profitability and sector. New additions to the index must have a minimum market cap of $15.8 billion or more, trade at least 250,000 shares monthly and be profitable, among other things.\n\nThe index committee updates these requirements periodically, particularly the market cap minimum. Companies already in the index that fall short of updated capitalization requirements aren't necessarily dropped -- some of the stocks on this list are examples. The committee reviews all eligibility criteria to make removal decisions.\n\nWhile there is no dividend requirement for S&P 500 stocks, about three-quarters of them do provide cash returns to shareholders. Collectively, S&P 500 stocks produce a dividend yield of 1.4%.\n\nThat modest yield is generally considered the price you pay for quality. But you know what? You don't have to settle for sub-2% yields from these leading dividend payers. In truth, there are dozens of good S&P 500 stocks that yield 3% or more. Ten of them are introduced below.\n\nThe brain trust at Forbes has run the numbers, conducted the research, and done the analysis to come up with some of the best places for you to make money in 2024. Download Forbes' most popular report, 12 Best Stocks To Buy for 2024.\n\nMethodology Used To Pick These Dividend Stocks\n\nTo identify these 10 dividend stocks, I started with all stocks included in SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD SPYD ). The fund tracks the performance of the S&P 500 High Dividend Index, which includes the top 80 yielding stocks in the S&P 500. I then screened that group to remove any that do not have an average analyst rating of moderate buy or higher. Of the resulting list, these are the top 10 in terms of dividend yield.\n\nThe 10 Highest Paying Dividend Stocks In The S&P 500\n\nThe table below lists 10 S&P 500 dividend payers that analysts like, with yields of 3.25% or higher.\n\nThis group of stocks is not intended to be a diversified dividend portfolio. You'll see that real estate is heavily represented here, for example. That's not surprising, since real estate investment trusts are required to pay high dividends to retain their favorable tax status. You should understand the risks associated with REITs before diving in.\n\nAlso note that REIT dividends are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified dividends are taxed at the lower capital gains rate. Yields shown here are pretax.\n\nAT&T is a major telecom provider with a history of hefty dividend yields. The company lost its Dividend Aristocrat status in 2021 after spinning off WarnerMedia and slashing its dividend.\n\nStill, AT&T remains a top-yielding stock, currently at 6.5%. More importantly, the telecom has made strides improving the sustainability of its dividend with an improved cost structure and balance sheet, plus rising cash flow.\n\nVICI owns gaming and entertainment properties, including Caesars Palace Las Vegas and MGM Grand. The company also owns golf courses and finances properties for other operators.\n\nIn 2023, VICI grew revenues by 38.9% to $3.6 billion. The company also generated $2.5 billion in net income, up 124.9% from the prior year. Shareholders reaped rewards, too, with a 6.4% dividend increase last year. VICI has increased its dividend six times in six years, good for a current yield of 5.8%.\n\nKeyCorp provides consumer and commercial banking services through regional bank chain KeyBank.\n\nKEY stock had a tough year last year, shedding about 18% of its value when several larger banking peers rose. One catalyst was the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB VB ), which dragged down smaller regional banking stocks in its wake.\n\nThose smaller banks have been challenged to manage through rising interest rates, credit quality declines and a soft lending environment. Despite those factors, KEY did make progress improving its balance sheet and shifting to a more growth-oriented strategy. In time, those changes should deliver a stronger bank. For now, shareholders are getting a 5.7% yield as they wait for conditions to improve.\n\nEvergy generates and distributes electricity to homes, businesses and municipalities.\n\nFor 2023, Evergy reported lower GAAP EPS of $3.17 vs. $3.27 in the prior year. Unfavorable weather played a role in the decline, along with higher expenses for interest, depreciation and amortization.\n\nEven so, analysts like the company's strategy and growth outlook. The strategy includes operational and financial execution, alongside regulatory activities that will benefit future earnings. Evergy's stated growth target is 4% to 6% through 2026. The stock currently has a yield of 5.0%.\n\nStop chasing shadows in the market. Forbes' expert analysts have pinpointed the 12 superstars poised to ignite returns in 2024. Don't miss out -- download 12 Best Stocks To Buy For 2024 and claim your front-row seat to the coming boom.\n\nHuntington Bancshares provides commercial, consumer and mortgage banking services through regional banking chain Huntington National Bank.\n\nHBAN's stock price has been slightly more resilient than KEY's in the past 12 months. Still, the environment remains challenging and that has affected HBAN's results. The good news is that interest rate hikes have paused and the business climate for smaller banks should improve.\n\nIn the meantime, HBAN has momentum in deposits. The bank's conservative underwriting discipline has also produced high-quality loan growth. The current yield is 4.5%.\n\nRegency Centers is a REIT that develops, owns and manages shopping centers in suburban neighborhoods.\n\nIn 2023, REG reported a $40 million gain in core operating earnings, to $700 million. The net income result was less favorable, due to various one-time events in 2022 and 2023. Regency sports a yield of 4.5%.\n\nA significant company milestone in 2023 was the completion of the Urstadt Biddle acquisition. The deal increases REG's leadership position and footprint in grocery-anchored shopping centers. The larger inventory combined with REG's disciplined approach to capital management and commitment to managing ESG risks set the stage for long-term growth.\n\nEntergy produces and distributes electricity in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.\n\nEntergy grew in 2023, with adjusted EPS of $6.77 vs. $6.42 in the prior year. The company has also beat analysts' EPS expectations in six of the last seven quarters, despite underperforming on revenue.\n\nETR's dividend yield of 4.4% is respectable, especially in light of the company's low valuation metrics. The PE ratio of 9.3 compares favorably to ETR's five-year average PE of 17.3 and the peer group PE of 24.0.\n\nFederal Realty is a REIT that specializes in mixed-use properties combining spaces for living, working, shopping and dining.\n\nFRT has the elite title of Dividend King, meaning it has increased its dividend annually for the most recent 50 years. With 56 consecutive years of dividend increases, FRT has the longest-running dividend growth record of any REIT.\n\nFederal Realty's dividend performance to date doesn't guarantee future results, of course. It does, however, demonstrate leadership discipline and the ability to manage through all economic cycles. FRT currently has a 4.4% yield.\n\nVentas is a REIT that owns and leases senior living communities, medical buildings and hospitals.\n\nVTR's normalized funds from operations, a REIT-specific cash flow measure, remained steady from 2022 to 2023. Nareit FFO, a standardized measure, grew 15.6%.\n\nMore compelling than recent performance is VTR's outlook. CEO Debra A. Cafaro expects to see \"unprecedented\" demand for senior housing in 2024 and beyond. That demand, driven by an aging population, creates a huge growth opportunity for VTR. Analysts agree. On average, they see about 20% upside in VTR's share price. Ventas has a yield of 4.2%.\n\nChevron is an integrated oil and gas company based in California.\n\nCVX has a solid balance sheet and a long history of returning value to shareholders. The company has increased its dividend annually for more than 35 years. In the last three years, Chevron's annualized dividend growth amounts to 5.4%. That history, combined with a conservative payout ratio of 57.4% sets the stage of relatively reliable and growing dividend income going forward. Chevron has a current yield of 4.2%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThrough careful research, you can earn impressive dividend yields from market-leading companies. That has to be more satisfying than a great-tasting light beer, right? Remember to keep an eye on your sector diversification and consider reinvesting those dividends to ramp up your income-earning portfolio faster.",

        "body": "Meta, Microsoft, X and online dating giant Match Group hit at Apple on Wednesday for overcharging on app purchases.\n\nThe four companies filed a rare joint amicus brief in a California court in charge of applying a ruling that Apple must allow companies to link to alternative payment options outside the app store for iPhone users.\n\nThat ruling was stemmed from a 2020 lawsuit by video gaming giant Epic Games, which has been fighting Apple in courts across the globe for years over its strict app store policies.\n\nApple takes a cut of as much as 30 percent on all financial transactions in its app shop, prompting complaints about an unfair \"tax\" on companies.\n\nA federal court in San Francisco overwhelmingly rejected Epic's lawsuit in 2021, offering only a concession that apps could indicate other ways of paying for services outside of Apple's ecosystem.\n\nBut Apple's compliance with the order earlier this year drew a furious response from Epic, which went to court arguing that it was defying the judge's intentions.\n\nApple's proposed solution allows it a 12 to 27 percent fee on external purchases outside its app store, which amounts to just a small discount from what it charged within the app store.\n\n\"The Apple Plan comports with neither the letter nor the spirit of this Court's mandate,\" Meta, Microsoft, X and Match said in their joint filing on Wednesday, in support of Epic.\n\nThe plan's \"new restrictions are plainly designed to render alternatives to Apple's in-app purchases impractical for developers, and inaccessible and unappealing to consumers,\" they added.\n\nApple told AFP that it has \"fully complied with the injunction,\" of the judge, which allows it to take measures needed to protect users.\n\nThese measures also \"guard against the uncompensated use of, among other things, Apple's platform, services... and proprietary tools and technologies protected by intellectual property,\" the company said, quoting its compliance statement sent to the court.",

        "body": "Apple previously stated that it had fully complied with the injunction\n\nMeta Platforms, Microsoft, Elon Musk's X and Match Group on Wednesday joined \"Fortnite\" video game maker Epic Games' protest that Apple has failed to honor a court-ordered injunction governing payments in its lucrative App Store.\n\nThe technology companies, which developed some of the most popular apps in the App Store, said Apple was in \"clear violation\" of the Sept. 2021 injunction by making it difficult to steer consumers to cheaper means to pay for digital content.\n\nApple declined to comment specifically on the accusation, which was contained in a filing with the Oakland, California federal court.\n\nIt referred to its Jan. 16 statement that it had fully complied with the injunction, which it said would protect consumers and \"the integrity of Apple's ecosystem\" while ensuring that developers do not get a free ride.\n\nEpic had sued Apple in 2020, saying it violated antitrust law by requiring consumers to obtain apps through the App Store and charging developers up to 30% commissions on purchases.\n\nThe injunction required Apple to let developers provide links and buttons to direct consumers to alternative payment options.\n\nLast week, Epic demanded that Apple be held in contempt, saying new rules and a new 27% fee on developers made the links effectively useless.\n\nIn Wednesday's filing, the technology companies said Apple's conduct \"for all practical purposes\" entrenches anti-steering rules that the court found illegal, propping up Apple's \"excessive\" commissions and harming consumers and developers.\n\n\"Apple's restrictions on where and how developers can communicate with their users about their options for purchasing in-app content create significant barriers to competition and artificially inflate prices,\" the filing said.\n\nIn January, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear Apple's appeal from the injunction. It also decided against hearing Epic's appeal of lower court findings that Apple's policies did not violate federal antitrust law.\n\nApple has until April 3 to formally respond to Epic's filing. The company is based in Cupertino, California, while Epic is based in Cary, North Carolina.\n\nThe case is Epic Games Inc v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 20-05640.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2024",

        "body": "Chicago, IL - March 18, 2024 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Atmos Energy Corp. ATO, Balchem Corp. BCPC, Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH, Casey's General Stores, Inc. CASY and Colgate-Palmolive Co. CL.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Low-Beta Stocks for Safe Returns as Inflation Sticks\n\nInflation rose for the second consecutive month in February, raising concerns of a rate cut anytime soon. The Labor Department reported on Mar 12 that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4% in February. Although the jump came in line with the economists' expectations, it was higher than January's jump of 0.3%.\n\nAlso, this was the biggest jump since September 2023, following which inflation declined steadily, encouraging the Federal Reserve to halt interest rate hikes.\n\nYear over year, CPI rose 3.2% in February after increasing 3.1% in January. Core CPI, which strips out the volatile energy and food prices, also rose 0.4% month over month in February, surpassing the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.3%.\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, core CPI rose 3.8% in February, higher than January's rise of 3.7%.\n\nInflation has declined sharply from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022 and fell below 3% at the end of 2023 as the Federal Reserve adopted an aggressive monetary tightening campaign. However, it has once again climbed above 3% this year and remains a lot higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has struggled to bring down inflation to its target level despite increasing interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark policy rate to the current range of 5.25-5.5%.\n\nPersonal income remains elevated, which has seen personal spending increase steadily. Also, the economy is still holding strong with the GDP increasing 2.5% in the final quarter of 2023.\n\nHowever, rising inflation has once again dimmed hopes of a rate cut anytime soon. In early January, market participants were expecting the first rate cut to come in March but the Federal Reserve ruled out the possibility of citing high inflation.\n\nCurrently, the timing of the first rate cut remains uncertain as May, too, looks unlikely, with many expecting it to not happen before the second half.\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be prudent to invest in low-beta stocks that offer a high dividend yield and carry a favorable Zacks Rank. This strategy allows for potential gains if the market regains momentum, leveraging the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks. Conversely, in case of a continued downtrend, low-beta stocks can help minimize losses in the portfolio, while their dividend payments serve as a consistent income source.\n\nThese stocks also have a high dividend yield, a solid growth potential for 2024 and a favorable Zacks Rank. Each of the stocks has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAtmos Energy Corporation, along with its subsidiaries, is engaged in the regulated natural gas distribution and storage business.

        "body": "Chevron oil spills settlement: Chevron has agreed to pay a substantial settlement amounting to $13.1 million to resolve past oil spill incidents in Kern County, Bakersfield, announced the California natural resources agency on Wednesday.\n\nThe settlement, reached with two California state agencies, marks a significant step in addressing environmental concerns stemming from the oil spills. Chevron, having previously covered the cleanup costs for the spills that occurred in 2019, will now allocate $5.6 million to the California Department of Conservation and $7.5 million to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), as outlined in the agreement.\n\nThe spills, which occurred in Kern County, involved a minimum of 800,000 gallons of oil and water, as reported by local media outlets. This settlement represents the largest fine historically imposed by both departments.\n\nIn response to inquiries, Chevron emphasised its ongoing commitment to addressing environmental issues and preventing similar incidents in the future. The company underscored the significance of these settlements as a demonstration of proactive measures toward environmental stewardship.\n\nA significant portion of the settlement funds, $5.6 million, will be directed towards ongoing efforts to address old and orphaned wells. Additionally, $7.5 million will be allocated to various environmental enhancement projects, including oil wildlife response preparedness and future spill response funding.\n\nAccording to records from CDFW, Chevron was linked to over 70 oil spills between 2018 and 2023 in Kern County alone, resulting in the release of more than 446,600 gallons (equivalent to 10,633 barrels) of oil. These spills had adverse effects, leading to the death or injury of at least 63 animals and impacting approximately six acres of salt brush and grassland habitat.\n\n(With Reuters inputs.)",

        "body": "Attorney General Ashley Moody | Office of Attorney General Ashley Moody\n\nAttorney General Ashley Moody has filed criminal charges against Jereome Downing, the leader of an organized theft ring, for stealing nearly half a million dollars in heavy equipment from Home Depot stores. Downing faces multiple felony charges for his involvement in the scheme, which resulted in significant losses for both Home Depot and innocent civilians.\n\nIn a statement, Attorney General Ashley Moody expressed, \"This scheme not only resulted in major losses to Home Depot, but also losses for innocent civilians buying stolen rental equipment under false pretenses. Thanks to the many law enforcement partners in this case and our Statewide Prosecutors, this defendant's final rent is now due, and he faces serious felony charges.\"\n\nThe investigation revealed that Downing utilized straw purchasers with prepaid credit cards to rent heavy equipment from Home Depot, which he then promptly listed for sale on Facebook Marketplace at discounted prices. Downing claimed to be a wholesaler selling items before auction and provided false Bill of Sale documents to the civilian purchasers. This elaborate scheme resulted in the theft and sale of 21 different pieces of rental equipment across multiple Home Depot stores in various judicial circuits in Florida.\n\nDowning now faces charges including organized scheme to defraud $50,000 or more, conspiracy to commit organized scheme to defraud $50,000 or more, fraudulent use of personal identification, and unlawful sublease of a motor vehicle.\n\nThe Miami-Dade Police Department and Port St. Lucie Police Department, with the assistance of local jurisdictions, conducted the investigation.

They qualify for credits toward a fire science degree at Dickinson State University and are also in position to pursue jobs with fire departments.\n\n\"Most departments in the state will require, at minimum, Firefighter 1 certification, which is what students will get after they have successfully completed the cognitive and practical exams,\" said Eberle. \"This program also offers Firefighter 2 certification as a possibility for students.\"\n\nThe grant from the Dickinson renewable diesel facility adds to its ongoing support for the local community and first responders throughout the area. The facility's fire brigade maintains a mutual aid agreement with all surrounding fire departments in Stark County, meaning they will provide resources and equipment to each other, as needed, during emergencies. Eberle pointed out how the grant brings it all full circle.\n\n\"In the future, we might be working side by side with these students if we ever need to call upon outside help or are asked to assist another department,\" he said.\n\nAt the grant check presentation, (L-R) Dickinson Lieutenant Dustin Hofer, Dickinson Senior Firefighter Mason Gieger, (in red shirts) students enrolled in the Firefighter 1 Academy course, Dickinson Firefighter Matthew Davenport, Dickinson Renewable Diesel Facility Manager Nick Bear and Dickinson Renewable Diesel Facility Interim Fire Chief Nate Eberle.\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Marathon Petroleum Corporation on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\n\nSpokesperson: Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/marathon-petroleum-corporation\n\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\nVideo-Workshop: Das kleine Einmaleins der CharttechnikIn diesem kostenlosen Video-Workshop von Stefan Klotter lernen Sie alles \u00fcber Charttechnik.

Elevance intends to add Kroger Specialty Pharmacy to its CarelonRx business, which houses its pharmacy benefit management services.\n\nKroger Specialty Pharmacy works with patients facing a wide array of chronic and complex conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, growth hormone deficiencies, multiple sclerosis and bleeding disorders. Patients are connected with a clinical team and therapy programs that offer education, side effect management, financial assistance, counseling, personalized care and more.\n\n\"Kroger Specialty Pharmacy has been part of our company since 2012, and we want to thank our management team and associates for their enduring commitment to their patients,\" said Colleen Lindholz, president of Kroger Health, in the press release.\n\n\"As part of our regular review of assets, it became clear that our strong specialty pharmacy business unit will better meet its full potential outside of our business,\" Lindholz said. \"One of the most important considerations was continued operations to ensure minimal disruption to our associates and patients. We are confident this transaction will help the business to grow and deliver better results for patients. We look forward to working toward a smooth transition for associates and patients.\"\n\nThe retailer noted that the specialty pharmacy arm is separate from Kroger's in-store retail pharmacies and Little Clinic locations, which are not included in the deal.\n\nKroger and Elevance Health have an existing partnership, joining forces to launch co-branded Medicare Advantage plans in 2021.",

        "body": "Specialty pharmacies dispense expensive prescription medicines for complex, chronic conditions. They're a key source of revenue for PBMs: Less than 2% of the U.S. population takes specialty drugs, according to industry estimates, but the prescriptions account for 50% of total U.S. pharmacy spend. Specialty drugs can result in profits of hundreds or even thousands of dollars per prescription.\n\nSpecialty pharmacies also provide wraparound services like side-effect management and personalized care. As a result, it's a difficult segment of the pharmacy supply chain for other players to disrupt, at a time when legacy PBMs are losing clients to newer businesses with more transparent business models.\n\nFor example, CVS Caremark -- one of the largest PBMs in the U.S. -- lost a massive client in Blue Shield of California late last year, when the payer decided to contract with multiple vendors for pharmacy services instead. However, BSCA retained Caremark for its specialty business, in part due to the difficulty of switching specialty vendors.\n\nAs such, Kroger's specialty business could be a valuable addition for CarelonRx.\n\nElevance's PBM has hustled to build out its specialty offerings since launching in 2019 as IngenioRx: Early last year, Elevance completed its acquisition of BioPlus, one of the largest specialty pharmacy organizations in the U.S. And in March, Elevance closed its buy of Paragon Healthcare, a company that provides infusion services, including through specialty pharmacies.\n\nCarelonRx has steadily grown to account for more of Elevance's topline. CarelonRx brought in $33.8 billion in revenue last year, up 19% year over year, and notched the highest operating margin of Elevance's reportable segments, at 5.8%, according to a 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year\n\nMeanwhile, Kroger is divesting assets as it looks to get a $25 billion merger with competitor Albertsons across the finish line. The Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal last month, citing anticompetitive concerns.",

        "body": "The feds are aggressively trying to halt business mergers that regulators say are harmful to us.\n\nBack in 1883, a man named Bernard Kroger invested his life savings of $372 to open his first grocery store in Cincinnati.\n\nToday, Kroger has about 430,000 employees and 3,000 stores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, a college student named Joe Albertson worked his way up from grocery clerk at Safeway to manager of a dozen stores. In 1939, he opened his first store in Boise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday Albertsons has 285,000 employees and 2,200 stores.\n\nWatchdog Alert\n\nAre you a taxpayer in Texas? The Watchdog has your back.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIf Bernard and Joe could join up today, their Kroger/Albertsons would jointly have 5,000 stores and more than 700,000 employees, according to company filings.\n\nAnd that's exactly what the heirs to the founders are hoping for. Albertsons and Kroger want to merge but the Federal Trade Commission says, \"Not so fast.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn legal papers to stop the deal, the FTC says the merger would hurt consumers and raise prices. Kroger/Albertsons says the opposite will happen: because of the large-scale purchasing power, prices will go down.\n\nWho to believe?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor comparison sakes, the success of Walmart, cited as a need for the merger, has 2 million employees and 4,600 stores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it's not just the grocery business suffering from zealous federal regulators. In recent months the heavy hand of the FTC has come down hard on companies that subscribe to the popular merge-or-die syndrome of American business.\n\nThe Albertsons /Kroger proposal caught The Watchdog's eye because that's close to home for most of us North Texans.\n\nI dug around and found the number of blocked mergers quite remarkable. The Biden administration, acting through the U.S. Justice Department and the FTC, has embarked on the most aggressive promotion of competition in decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat follows the lead of President Joe Biden, who signed an executive order in 2021 that called for \"more robust scrutiny\" of bank-related deals.\n\nHalted mergers\n\nJetBlue Airways called off a $3.8 billion merger with Spirit Airlines. A Spirit executive cited \"regulatory uncertainty.\" JetBlue must pay Spirit a \"breakup fee\" of $69 million. This deal was halted after pressure from the Justice Department and a federal judge who said it would hinder fair competition.\n\nExxonMobil announced it wants to buy Irving-based Pioneer Natural Resources for $59.5 billion. In a statement, Pioneer said the companies \"continue to work constructively with the Federal Trade Commission in its review of the merger.\" Democratic U.S. senators are applying pressure, saying the sale is harmful to consumers and anti-competitive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCapitol One announced its intention to buy Discover Financial Services in a $35.3 billion deal. Federal regulators haven't announced their intention to block it, but President Biden has made it clear that he wants to thwart anti-competitive practices, especially in the financial world.\n\nChoice Hotels dropped its takeover of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. The FTC called it a win for consumers because it promotes competition.\n\nGood for consumers?\n\nI talked to economics teachers at both Southern Methodist University and Texas Christian University. I expected them to support the basic idea that blocking the merging of big companies is bad for consumers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeither one did. They're not buying the argument by regulators that consolidation is always bad for consumers.\n\nMost deals are done for the benefit of stockholders, not consumers, TCU's Audra Boone says. Promises that prices will drop, not rise, are almost impossible to prove, especially without a thorough economic analysis.\n\nRegulators argue that less competition automatically means higher prices.\n\nKroger/Albertsons counters, saying that by growing larger they become more efficient, and they can pass those savings on to consumers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSMU's Michael Davis says, \"It worries me a lot when lawyers in Washington look out there and say, 'OK, this is what's important in the grocery store.' The grocery store people are in a better position to know that than lawyers in Washington.\"\n\nDavis is critical of regulators' goals of \"creating a new kind of business landscape that, to put it bluntly, suits their taste. Even if there's really no harm to consumers, the FTC is happy to bring an antitrust lawsuit.\"\n\nBoone said these roadblocks put up to slow mergers down would likely not happen in a Republican administration.\n\nBiden appointed Lina M. Khan to chair the FTC. She said in one speech I read that her commission's aggressiveness, along with the DOJ, has deterred bankers and deal lawyers from launching \"illegal deals.\"\n\nAdvertisementKroger/Albertsons\n\nKroger wants to buy Albertsons in the biggest supermarket merger in history -- a $24.6 billion deal.\n\nThe FTC says it will hurt pricing, result in lower quality goods and services and hurt employees' wages, benefits and working conditions.\n\nAttorneys general in eight states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit to stop the deal. Texas is not one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn court papers, Albertsons argues it is bedeviled by competition from Walmart, Target, Costco, Amazon/Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and Sprouts.\n\nTo put sugar on top of the deal, Kroger/Albertsons say they would invest $500 million to cut prices and $1 billion to increase workers' pay and benefits and another $1.3 billion to update Albertsons stores.\n\nOn the joint KrogerAlbertsons.com website, Kroger promises: \"Kroger will not close any stores, distribution centers or manufacturing facilities or lay off any frontline associates as a result of the merger.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTCU's Boone says those most likely to get hurt are people living in areas without many grocery stores.\n\n\"Overall, it will be interesting to see how this plays out,\" she says. \"Most FTC claims do not result in a trial. Companies either abandon the deal or they are able to make enough concessions that the FTC offers it approval.\"\n\nMy takeaway: If the FTC wants to shutter the Kroger/Albertsons deal, it must do a better job of proving its claims of antitrust. Saying that consumers will automatically get hurt must be proven in the biggest deal in supermarket history. To me, it seems like the grocery market is already highly competitive.\n\nIt's a long way from the origins of Bernard Kroger and Joe Albertson to this $24 billion deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecome a citizen of Watchdog Nation.\n\nJoin Dave Lieber and learn to be a super-consumer.\n\nWatchdog newsletter: Sign up for The Watchdog's FREE weekly newsletter to keep up: click here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSubscribe: PLEASE support The Watchdog's brand of straightforward journalism designed to save you time, money and aggravation.

        "body": "Hamilton County residents could soon have another grocery store option -- this one on the southeast side of Noblesville.\n\nThe Kroger Marketplace would be built at the northeast corner of Howe Road and East 146th Street. The grocery store is part of a larger development, called Star Brick Village, which was introduced to the Noblesville Common Council last week.\n\n\"This will come as a welcome, additional option to the residents, especially with the departure of Marsh (Supermarkets) several years ago,\" said council member David Johnson, whose district includes the planned development.\n\nJohnson noted that residents in that part of Noblesville, especially near the Hamilton Town Center, would have a much closer option for a large grocery store if the development moves forward.\n\nAlso in Hamilton County: Kroger confirms plan to move across Allisonville Road in Fishers, shares details of new store\n\nAlso included in the development plan are 98 single-family homes developed by David Weekley, a Kroger fuel station and locations for other new businesses, according to an introductory presentation from developers at the March 12 Noblesville City Council meeting.\n\nThe Kroger grocery store is expected to include a Starbucks counter inside. The homes are planned for the north side of the 71.5-acre development, close to an existing pond that will be maintained, with walking trails added.\n\nThe planned development site is adjacent to Promise Road Elementary School and close to the Noblesville Airport. Construction for the development will begin this summer if approved by the city. The project will need approval from the Noblesville Plan Commission before it is back on the common council's agenda.\n\nOn Monday, Kroger broke ground on a different development about six miles south of the Star Brick Village site. The grocery-store chain is replacing a smaller Kroger store across the street at Allisonville Road and 116th Street in Fishers with a new 120,000-square-feet location.\n\nKroger also has a location near the intersection of Hazel Dell Parkway and East 146th Street in Noblesville. This location is about five miles west of the Star Brick Village site.\n\nContact Jake Allen at jake.allen@indystar.com. Follow him on Twitter @Jake_Allen19.",

        "title": "Ford Motor Company (F) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "body": "Ford Motor Company (F) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this company have returned -1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Ford Motor Company belongs, has lost 10.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.44 per share, indicating a change of -30.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.88 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -6.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.87 indicates a change of -0.7% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Ford Motor Company.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Ford Motor Company, the consensus sales estimate of $39.96 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.3%. The $166 billion and $165.79 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of 0% and -0.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nFord Motor Company reported revenues of $43.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $0.29 for the same period compares with $0.51 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +14.08%. The EPS surprise was +141.67%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Ford Motor Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nFord Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nGlobal demand for oil is through the roof... and oil producers are struggling to keep up.

        "body": "The most recent trading session ended with Verizon Communications (VZ) standing at $39.93, reflecting a +1.11% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.63%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.2%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.82%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the largest U.S. cellphone carrier had lost 2.47% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.16% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.76% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Verizon Communications in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on April 22, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $1.12, indicating a 6.67% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $33.44 billion, showing a 1.61% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $4.59 per share and a revenue of $135.65 billion, signifying shifts of -2.55% and +1.25%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Verizon Communications. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.12% higher. Verizon Communications is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at valuation, Verizon Communications is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 8.6. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.81.\n\nWe can additionally observe that VZ currently boasts a PEG ratio of 3.01. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Wireless National industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.53 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nThe Wireless National industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 152, which puts it in the bottom 40% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nA massive push to rebuild the crumbling U.S. infrastructure will soon be underway. It's bipartisan, urgent, and inevitable. Trillions will be spent. Fortunes will be made.\n\nThe only question is \"Will you get into the right stocks early when their growth potential is greatest?\"\n\nZacks has released a Special Report to help you do just that, and today it's free.

        "body": "Loading...Loading...\n\nBASKING RIDGE, N.J., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon Innovative Learning, the company's signature education initiative focused on driving digital equity and inclusion through a suite of programs and resources, is continuing to partner with the National Association for Community College Entrepreneurship (NACCE) to bring the Verizon Innovative Learning STEM Achievers program to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and community colleges.\n\nVerizon Innovative Learning STEM Achievers is a free, project-based immersive STEM program open to middle school students in under-resourced communities to explore STEM subjects, learn problem-solving skills and gain exposure to career opportunities in technology fields. In 2023, 90% of students in the summer program said they enjoy learning new things that involve STEM and 83% said that they can use STEM to impact issues affecting the community, nation, and/or the world. This year, Verizon Innovative Learning STEM Achievers is expanding and now able to accommodate more students: from 11,900 last year to 13,500+ students this year.\n\nThe program's interactive curriculum, developed by Verizon in partnership with Arizona State University's J. Orin Edson Entrepreneurship + Innovation Institute, centers on four educational tracks: immersive media, smart solutions, digital product innovations and artificial intelligence. Participating students receive mentorship, access to next-gen technology - such as 3D printing, augmented reality (AR) and robotics, and hands-on training connected to real-world challenges that help teach design thinking and social entrepreneurship. The program is held on the campuses of 45 HBCUs, HSIs and community colleges across the country.\n\n\"As tech and AI continue accelerating the pace of innovation, it's up to all business leaders to ensure digital equity and inclusion,\" said Rose Stuckey Kirk, Verizon's Chief Corporate Social Responsibility Officer. \"One of our many strategies to address this is Verizon Innovative Learning's STEM Achievers summer program, in partnership with NACCE, which provides students with hands-on learning, mentorship, and opportunities to engage with emerging technologies and develop the necessary skills to succeed in the digital workforce. The opportunity for students to engage with tech over the summer and propel their own learning and digital skills can set them up for success during the school year, beyond middle school and in life. Verizon Innovative Learning STEM Achievers do big and bold things through the program and beyond - both inside and outside the classroom - and Verizon is honored to be part of their journey.\"\n\nFree registration is now open for parents to sign up their rising 6th - 8th grade students for the summer sessions being offered in-person. The Verizon Innovative Learning STEM Achievers program also consists of one in-person full-day workshop, both in the fall and spring, onsite at the partner college. To sign up for Verizon Innovative Learning STEM Achievers, please visit here.\n\nNext-gen learning for all\n\nTeachers and students can also leverage Verizon Innovative Learning HQ, an award-winning, free education portal that makes next-gen learning tools, including a curated collection of lesson plans, available to all. Through Verizon Innovative Learning HQ, K-12 educators nationwide gain free access to over 375 lesson plans with 22 corresponding augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) apps. The education portal also provides educators with extensive training and resources, including over 50 professional development courses. Educators can visit Verizon.com/Learning to sign up.\n\nVerizon Innovative Learning, Verizon's award-winning education initiative, is celebrating over a decade of commitment to addressing barriers to digital inclusion for students and teachers. Since 2012, the initiative has committed $1 billion in market value to support digital equity, reaching over 7 million students. Verizon Innovative Learning provides free technology, internet access and innovative learning programs to students in under-resourced communities - enabling students to develop the skills, knowledge and confidence needed to build an innovative workforce of the future. A key initiative under Citizen Verizon, the company's responsible business plan for economic, environmental and social advancement, Verizon Innovative Learning is helping to drive the company's goal to provide 10 million youths with digital skills training by 2030.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. ((NYSE, NASDAQ:VZ) was formed in 2000 and is one of the world's leading providers of technology and communications services.

        "body": "Wednesday, March 20, 2024\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) and SAP SE (SAP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\n\nShares of JPMorgan Chase have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past year (+53.0% vs. +37.0%). Higher interest rates, buyouts, opening new branches and decent loan demand will aid net interest income (NII), though rising funding costs will weigh on it.\n\nWhile there has been a resurgence in M&A activities so far this year, a complete revival in deal-making is not certain. Thus, the performance of the investment banking (IB) business is not expected to improve significantly.\n\nAlong with this, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates, will likely hamper fee income growth. Mounting operating expenses will hurt profits.\n\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\n\nMerck shares have gained +15.7% over the past six months against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's gain of +16.7%. The company's products like Keytruda and Gardasil have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth.\n\nAnimal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth. The company is investing in M&A activity to strengthen its pipeline.\n\nHowever, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck's ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda's loss of exclusivity later in the decade.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)\n\nShares of SAP have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+54.7% vs. +51.2%). The company's performance is benefiting from continued strength in its cloud business, especially the Rise with SAP and Grow with SAP solutions. Momentum in SAP's business technology platform, particularly the S/4HANA solution, along with proliferation of generative AI bodes well.\n\nSAP is now focusing more on vital strategic growth areas, especially Business AI, and position the company for future growth. Management also reaffirmed its 2025 long-term targets for cloud and total revenues. Frequent product launches, and strategic acquisitions and collaborations are other tailwinds.\n\nHowever, continued softness in the Software license and support business segment coupled with global macroeconomic weakness are concerning. Increasing costs and stiff competition are additional headwinds.\n\n(You can read the full research report on SAP here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN) and Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B).\n\nDirector of Research\n\nSheraz Mian\n\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

The company's progress with the oncology portfolio & other candidates is also impressive\n\nBrown-Forman's (BF.B) Premiumization Strategy Bodes Well\n\nPer the Zacks analyst, Brown-Forman's premiumization strategy looks good, as evident from growth of its premium and super-premium brands. Strength in the Jack Daniel's family of brands is a key driver\n\nKnight-Swift (KNX) Benefits From Dividend Amid Cost Woes\n\nThe Zacks analyst likes the shareholder-friendly measures adopted by Knight-Swift. However, rise in operating expenses and high debt are likely to hurt the bottom line.\n\nRising Transactions Aid Euronet (EEFT), Escalating Costs Hurt\n\nPer the Zacks analyst, Euronet's topline is driven by well-performing segments, as well as increasing digital transactions and diversity. However, high costs might strain margins.\n\nSolid E-Jets Demand Aid Embraer (ERJ), High Fuel Price Ail\n\nPer the Zacks Analyst, solid market demand for its E-Jet family is boosting Embraer's commercial aviation revenues. However, rising fuel price might lead to lower jet orders for the company.\n\nCONMED's (CNMD) Robust Product Portfolio Offset Competition\n\nPer the Zacks analyst, CONMED's robust product portfolio, along with a solid recurring revenue base and solid market trends, are encouraging. However, tuff regulatory requirement space is worrying.\n\nNew Upgrades\n\nStrong SMB clientele Aids BILL Holdings' (BILL) Prospects\n\nPer the Zacks analyst, BILL is benefiting from an expanding small and medium business (SMB) clientele, as well as a diversified business model.\n\nSolid Demand, Pricing Actions Aid Carpenter Technology (CRS)\n\nPer the Zacks analyst, Carpenter Technology is gaining from strong demand across its end-use markets. Cost-reduction initiatives are also driving growth.\n\nNuStar (NS) to Gain from Acquisition by Sunoco\n\nThe Zacks analyst believes that NuStar Energy's buyout by Sunoco LP is expected to enhance growth prospects, with more cash flow for reinvestment across an expanded opportunity set.\n\nNew Downgrades\n\nSoftness In Agility & Reliability Business Segments Ail Flex\n\nPer the Zacks analyst, Flex's performance is affected due to weakness across the Agility and Reliability Solutions segments. Stiff competition is an added concern.\n\nRising Operating Costs and Forex Woes Hurt MRC Global (MRC)\n\nPer the Zacks analyst, MRC Global is struggling with high operating costs, which in turn, are hurting the company's bottom line. Forex woes are an added concern.\n\nIncreased Costs Likely to Hurt Live Nation's (LYV) Prospects\n\nPer the Zacks analyst, increased production expenses and artist activation costs are likely to hurt Live Nation.

Mounting operating expenses will hurt profits.\n\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\n\nMerck shares have gained +15.7% over the past six months against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's gain of +16.7%. The company's products like Keytruda and Gardasil have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth.\n\nAnimal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth. The company is investing in M&A activity to strengthen its pipeline.\n\nHowever, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck's ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda's loss of exclusivity later in the decade.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)\n\nShares of SAP have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+54.7% vs. +51.2%). The company's performance is benefiting from continued strength in its cloud business, especially the Rise with SAP and Grow with SAP solutions. Momentum in SAP's business technology platform, particularly the S/4HANA solution, along with proliferation of generative AI bodes well.\n\nSAP is now focusing more on vital strategic growth areas, especially Business AI, and position the company for future growth. Management also reaffirmed its 2025 long-term targets for cloud and total revenues. Frequent product launches, and strategic acquisitions and collaborations are other tailwinds.\n\nHowever, continued softness in the Software license and support business segment coupled with global macroeconomic weakness are concerning. Increasing costs and stiff competition are additional headwinds.\n\n(You can read the full research report on SAP here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The amount that you will be paid on your notes on the stated maturity date (April 23, 2025, subject to adjustment) is based on the performance of the Russell 2000 Index (which we refer to as the underlier) as measured from and including the trade date (March 18, 2024) to and including the determination date (April 21, 2025, subject to adjustment). If the final underlier level on the determination date is greater than the initial underlier level, the return on your notes will be positive, subject to the maximum settlement amount of $1,192.00 for each $1,000 principal amount note. If the final underlier level declines by up to 15.00% from the initial underlier level, you will receive the principal amount of your notes. If the final underlier level declines by more than 15.00% from the initial underlier level, the return on your notes will be negative. You could lose your entire investment in the notes. Any payment on the notes is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (\"JPMorgan Financial\"), as issuer of the notes, and the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor of the notes.\n\nTo determine your payment at maturity, we will calculate the underlier return, which is the percentage increase or decrease in the final underlier level from the initial underlier level. On the stated maturity date, for each $1,000 principal amount note, you will receive an amount in cash equal to:\n\nYour investment in the notes involves certain risks, including, among other things, our credit risk. See \"Risk Factors\" on page S-2 of the accompanying prospectus supplement, \"Risk Factors\" on page PS-11 of the accompanying product supplement and \"Selected Risk Factors\" on page PS-13 of this pricing supplement.\n\nThe foregoing is only a brief summary of the terms of your notes. You should read the additional disclosure provided herein so that you may better understand the terms and risks of your investment.\n\nThe estimated value of the notes, when the terms of the notes were set, was $985.00 per $1,000 principal amount note. See \"Summary Information -- The Estimated Value of the Notes\" on page PS-7 of this pricing supplement for additional information about the estimated value of the notes and \"Summary Information -- Secondary Market Prices of the Notes\" on page PS-8 of this pricing supplement for information about secondary market prices of the notes.\n\nSee \"Summary Information -- Supplemental Use of Proceeds\" on page PS-8 of this pricing supplement for information about the components of the original issue price of the notes.\n\n*J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, which we refer to as JPMS, acting as agent for JPMorgan Financial, will pay all of the selling commissions of 0.95% of the principal amount it receives from us to an unaffiliated dealer. See \"Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)\" on page PS-86 of the accompanying product supplement.\n\nNeither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") nor any other regulatory body has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this pricing supplement, the accompanying product supplement, the accompanying underlying supplement, the accompanying prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.\n\nThe notes are not bank deposits, are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency and are not obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.\n\nPricing Supplement dated March 18, 2024\n\nThe original issue price, fees and commissions and net proceeds listed above relate to the notes we sell initially. We may decide to sell additional notes after the date of this pricing supplement, at issue prices and with fees and commission and net proceeds that differ from the amounts set forth above. The return (whether positive or negative) on your investment in notes will depend in part on the price you pay for your notes.\n\nWe may use this pricing supplement in the initial sale of the notes. In addition, JPMS or any other affiliate of ours may use this pricing supplement in a market-making transaction in a note after its initial sale. Unless JPMS or its agents inform the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale, this pricing supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.\n\nIssuer: JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC, an indirect, wholly owned finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nGuarantor: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nUnderlier: the Russell 2000 Index (Bloomberg symbol, \"RTY Index\"), as published by FTSE Russell. The accompanying product supplement refers to the underlier as the \"Index.\"\n\nPrincipal amount: each note will have a principal amount of $1,000; $1,955,000 in the aggregate for all the offered notes; the aggregate principal amount of the offered notes may be increased if the issuer, at its sole option, decides to sell an additional amount of the offered notes on a date subsequent to the date of this pricing supplement\n\nPurchase at amount other than principal amount: the amount we will pay you at the stated maturity date for your notes will not be adjusted based on the price you pay for your notes, so if you acquire notes at a premium (or discount) to the principal amount and hold them to the stated maturity date, it could affect your investment in a number of ways. The return on your investment in the notes will be lower (or higher) than it would have been had you purchased the notes at the principal amount. Also, the stated trigger buffer level would not offer the same benefit to your investment as would be the case if you had purchased the notes at the principal amount. Additionally, the cap level would be triggered at a lower (or higher) percentage return than indicated below, relative to your initial investment. See \"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Notes Generally -- If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to the Principal Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at the Principal Amount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected\" on page PS-14 of this pricing supplement.\n\nPayment on the stated maturity date: for each $1,000 principal amount note, we will pay you on the stated maturity date an amount in cash equal to:\n\nInitial underlier level (the closing level of the underlier on the trade date): 2,024.735. The accompanying product supplement refers to the initial underlier level as the \"Initial Value.\"\n\nFinal underlier level: the closing level of the underlier on the determination date. In certain circumstances, the closing level of the underlier will be based on the alternative calculation of the underlier described under \"General Terms of Notes -- Postponement of a Determination Date -- Notes Linked to a Single Underlying -- Notes Linked to a Single Underlying (Other Than a Commodity Index)\" on page PS-45 of the accompanying product supplement or \"The Underlyings -- Indices -- Discontinuation of an Index; Alteration of Method of Calculation\" on page PS-68 of the accompanying product supplement.

The following discussion, when read in combination with that section, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of notes.\n\nBased on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel it is reasonable to treat the notes as \"open transactions\" that are not debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as more fully described in \"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences -- Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders -- Notes Treated as Open Transactions That Are Not Debt Instruments\" in the accompanying product supplement. Assuming this treatment is respected, the gain or loss on your notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of notes at the issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of \"prepaid forward contracts\" and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the \"constructive ownership\" regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.\n\nSection 871(m) of the Code and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (\"Section 871(m)\") generally impose a 30% withholding tax (unless an income tax treaty applies) on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to Non-U.S. Holders with respect to certain financial instruments linked to U.S. equities or indices that include U.S. equities. Section 871(m) provides certain exceptions to this withholding regime, including for instruments linked to certain broad-based indices that meet requirements set forth in the applicable Treasury regulations. Additionally, a recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have a delta of one with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an \"Underlying Security\"). Based on certain determinations made by us, our special tax counsel is of the opinion that Section 871(m) should not apply to the notes with regard to Non-U.S. Holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the notes.\n\nERISA: as described under \"Benefit Plan Investor Considerations\" on page PS-88 of the accompanying product supplement\n\nSupplemental plan of distribution: as described under \"Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)\" on page PS-86 of the accompanying product supplement; we estimate that our share of the total offering expenses, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $10,000. We have agreed to sell to JPMS, and JPMS has agreed to purchase from us, the aggregate principal amount of the notes specified on the front cover of this pricing supplement. JPMS proposes initially to offer the notes to the public at the original issue price set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement, and to an unaffiliated dealer at that price and to pay that dealer a selling commission of 0.95% of the principal amount.\n\nConflicts of interest: JPMS has a \"conflict of interest\" within the meaning of FINRA Rule 5121 in any offering of the notes in which it participates because JPMorgan Chase & Co. owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding equity securities of JPMS, because JPMS and we are under common control by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and because the net proceeds received from the sale of the notes will be used, in part, by JPMS or its affiliates in connection with hedging our obligations under the notes. The offering of the notes will comply with the requirements of Rule 5121 of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\"FINRA\") regarding a FINRA member firm's underwriting of securities of an affiliate. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5121, neither JPMS nor any other affiliated agent of ours may make sales in the offering of the notes to any of its discretionary accounts without the specific written approval of the customer.\n\nFDIC: the notes are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.\n\nSupplemental Terms of the Notes\n\nFor purposes of the notes offered by this pricing supplement, all references to each of the following terms used in the accompanying product supplement will be deemed to refer to the corresponding term used in this pricing supplement, as set forth in the table below:\n\nIn addition, the following terms used in this pricing supplement are not defined in the accompanying product supplement: underlier return, upside participation rate, maximum settlement amount, cap level and trigger buffer level. Accordingly, please refer to \"Key Terms\" on page PS-3 of this pricing supplement for the definitions of these terms.\n\nAny values of the underlier, and any values derived therefrom, included in this pricing supplement may be corrected, in the event of manifest error or inconsistency, by amendment of this pricing supplement.\n\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes\n\nThe estimated value of the notes when the terms of the notes are set, which we refer to as the estimated value of the notes, set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement is equal to the sum of the values of the following hypothetical components: (1) a fixed-income debt component with the same maturity as the notes, valued using the internal funding rate described below, and (2) the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes. The estimated value of the notes does not represent a minimum price at which JPMS would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may be based on, among other things, our and our affiliates' view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of JPMorgan Chase & Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes. For additional information, see \"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes -- The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Derived by Reference to an Internal Funding Rate\" on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement. The value of the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes is derived from internal pricing models of our affiliates. These models are dependent on inputs such as the traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on various other inputs, some of which are market-observable, and which can include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors, as well as assumptions about future market events and/or environments. Accordingly, the estimated value of the notes is determined when the terms of the notes are set based on market conditions and other relevant factors and assumptions existing at that time. See \"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes -- The Estimated Value of the Notes Does Not Represent Future Values of the Notes and May Differ from Others' Estimates\" on page PS-15 of this pricing supplement.\n\nThe estimated value of the notes is lower than the original issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions paid to JPMS and the unaffiliated dealer, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. Because\n\nhedging our obligations entails risk and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control, this hedging may result in a profit that is more or less than expected, or it may result in a loss. A portion of the profits realized in hedging our obligations under the notes, if any, may be allowed to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, and we or one or more of our affiliates will retain any remaining hedging profits. A fee will also be paid to iCapital Markets LLC, an electronic platform in which an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, who is acting as a dealer in connection with the distribution of the notes, holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering. See \"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes -- The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Lower Than the Original Issue Price of the Notes\" on page PS-15 of this pricing supplement.\n\nSecondary Market Prices of the Notes\n\nFor information about factors that will impact any secondary market prices of the notes, see \"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes -- Secondary Market Prices of the Notes Will Be Impacted by Many Economic and Market Factors\" on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement. In addition, we generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over the period from the trade date through June 18, 2024. The length of any such initial period reflects the structure of the notes, whether our affiliates expect to earn a profit in connection with our hedging activities, the estimated costs of hedging the notes and when these costs are incurred, as determined by our affiliates. See \"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes -- The Value of the Notes as Published by JPMS (and Which May Be Reflected on Customer Account Statements) May Be Higher Than the Then-Current Estimated Value of the Notes for a Limited Time Period\" on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement.\n\nSupplemental Use of Proceeds\n\nThe notes are offered to meet investor demand for products that reflect the risk-return profile and market exposure provided by the notes. See \"Hypothetical Examples\" on page PS-10 of this pricing supplement for an illustration of the risk-return profile of the notes and \"The Underlier\" on page PS-18 of this pricing supplement for a description of the market exposure provided by the notes.\n\nThe original issue price of the notes is equal to the estimated value of the notes plus the selling commissions paid to JPMS and the unaffiliated dealer, plus (minus) the projected profits (losses) that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes, plus the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes.\n\nValidity of the Notes and the Guarantee\n\nIn the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, as special products counsel to JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Chase & Co., when the notes offered by this pricing supplement have been issued by JPMorgan Financial pursuant to the indenture, the trustee and/or paying agent has made, in accordance with the instructions from JPMorgan Financial, the appropriate entries or notations in its records relating to the master global note that represents such notes (the \"master note\"), and such notes have been delivered against payment as contemplated herein, such notes will be valid and binding obligations of JPMorgan Financial and the related guarantee will constitute a valid and binding obligation of JPMorgan Chase & Co., enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith), provided that such counsel expresses no opinion as to (i) the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above or (ii) any provision of the indenture that purports to avoid the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law by limiting the amount of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s obligation under the related guarantee. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. In addition, this opinion is subject to customary assumptions about the trustee's\n\nauthorization, execution and delivery of the indenture and its authentication of the master note and the validity, binding nature and enforceability of the indenture with respect to the trustee, all as stated in the letter of such counsel dated February 24, 2023, which was filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 by JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Chase & Co. on February 24, 2023.\n\nHYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES\n\nThe following table and chart are provided for purposes of illustration only. They should not be taken as an indication or prediction of future investment results and are intended merely to illustrate the impact that the various hypothetical underlier levels on the determination date could have on the payment at maturity assuming all other variables remain constant.\n\nThe examples below are based on a range of final underlier levels that are entirely hypothetical; no one can predict what the underlier level will be on any day throughout the term of your notes, and no one can predict what the final underlier level will be on the determination date. The underlier has been highly volatile in the past -- meaning that the underlier level has changed considerably in relatively short periods -- and its performance cannot be predicted for any future period.\n\nThe information in the following examples reflects hypothetical rates of return on the offered notes assuming that they are purchased on the original issue date at the principal amount and held to the stated maturity date. If you sell your notes in a secondary market prior to the stated maturity date, your return will depend upon the market value of your notes at the time of sale, which may be affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the table below, such as interest rates, the volatility of the underlier and our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s creditworthiness. In addition, the estimated value of the notes is less than the original issue price. For more information on the estimated value of the notes, see \"Summary Information -- The Estimated Value of the Notes\" on page PS-7 of this pricing supplement. The information in the table also reflects the key terms and assumptions in the box below.\n\nFor these reasons, the actual performance of the underlier over the term of your notes, as well as the amount payable at maturity, if any, may bear little relation to the hypothetical examples shown below or to the historical underlier levels shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement. For information about the historical levels of the underlier during recent periods, see \"The Underlier -- Historical Closing Levels of the Underlier\" below. Before investing in the offered notes, you should consult publicly available information to determine the levels of the underlier between the date of this pricing supplement and the date of your purchase of the offered notes.\n\nAlso, the hypothetical examples shown below do not take into account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to your notes, tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your notes to a comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the underlier stocks.\n\nThe levels in the left column of the table below represent hypothetical final underlier levels and are expressed as percentages of the initial underlier level. The amounts in the right column represent the hypothetical payments at maturity, based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level), and are expressed as percentages of the principal amount of a note (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of a percent). Thus, a hypothetical\n\npayment at maturity of 100.000% means that the value of the cash payment that we would deliver for each $1,000 of the outstanding principal amount of the offered notes on the stated maturity date would equal 100.000% of the principal amount of a note, based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) and the assumptions noted above.\n\nIf, for example, the final underlier level were determined to be 25.000% of the initial underlier level, the payment that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be 25.000% of the principal amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your notes on the original issue date at the principal amount and held them to the stated maturity date, you would lose 75.000% of your investment (if you purchased your notes at a premium to principal amount you would lose a correspondingly higher percentage of your investment). In addition, if the final underlier level were determined to be 150.000% of the initial underlier level, the payment that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be capped at the maximum settlement amount (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount), or 119.200% of each $1,000 principal amount note, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you held your notes to the stated maturity date, you would not benefit from any increase in the final underlier level over 109.600% of the initial underlier level.\n\nThe following chart also shows a graphical illustration of the hypothetical payments at maturity (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of your notes) that we would pay on your notes on the stated maturity date, if the final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) were any of the hypothetical levels shown on the horizontal axis. The chart shows that any hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) of less than 85.000% (the section left of the 85.000% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a hypothetical payment at maturity of less than 100.000% of the principal amount of your notes (the section below the 100.000% marker on the vertical axis) and, accordingly, in a loss of principal to the holder of the notes. The chart also shows that any hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) of greater than or equal to 109.600% (the section right of the 109.600% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a capped return on your investment.\n\nThe payments at maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on closing levels for the underlier that may not be achieved on the determination date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your notes on the stated maturity date or at any other time, including any time you may wish to sell your notes, may bear little relation to the hypothetical payments at maturity shown above, and these amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the offered notes. The hypothetical payments at maturity on notes held to the stated maturity date in the examples above assume you purchased your notes at their principal amount and have not been adjusted to reflect the actual price you pay for your notes. The return on your investment (whether positive or negative) in your notes will be affected by the amount you pay for your notes. If you purchase your notes for a price other than the principal amount, the return on your investment will differ from, and may be significantly lower than, the hypothetical returns suggested by the above examples. Please read \"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes -- Secondary Market Prices of the Notes Will Be Impacted by Many Economic and Market Factors\" on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement.\n\nThe hypothetical returns on the notes shown above apply only if you hold the notes for their entire term. These hypotheticals do not reflect fees or expenses that would be associated with any sale in the secondary market. If these fees and expenses were included, the hypothetical returns shown above would likely be lower.\n\nWe cannot predict the actual final underlier level or what the market value of your notes will be on any particular day, nor can we predict the relationship between the underlier level and the market value of your notes at any time prior to the stated maturity date. The actual amount that you will receive, if any, at maturity and the rate of return on the offered notes will depend on the actual final underlier level determined by the calculation agent as described above. Moreover, the assumptions on which the hypothetical returns are based may turn out to be inaccurate. Consequently, the amount of cash to be paid in respect of your notes, if any, on the stated maturity date may be very different from the information reflected in the table and chart above.\n\nSelected Risk Factors\n\nAn investment in your notes is subject to the risks described below, as well as the risks described under the \"Risk Factors\" sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement and the accompanying product supplement. Your notes are a riskier investment than ordinary debt securities. Also, your notes are not equivalent to investing directly in the underlier stocks, i.e., the stocks underlying the underlier to which your notes are linked. You should carefully consider whether the offered notes are suited to your particular circumstances.\n\nRisks Relating to the Notes Generally\n\nYou May Lose Some or All of Your Investment in the Notes\n\nThe notes do not guarantee any return of principal. The return on the notes at maturity is linked to the performance of the underlier and will depend on whether, and the extent to which, the underlier return is positive or negative. If the final underlier level is less than the trigger buffer level, you will lose 1% of the principal amount of your notes for every 1% that the final underlier level is less than the initial underlier level. Accordingly, you could lose some or all of your initial investment at maturity. Also, the market price of your notes prior to the stated maturity date may be significantly lower than the purchase price you pay for your notes. Consequently, if you sell your notes before the stated maturity date, you may receive far less than the amount of your investment in the notes.\n\nYour Maximum Gain on the Notes Is Limited to the Maximum Settlement Amount\n\nIf the final underlier level is greater than the initial underlier level, for each $1,000 principal amount note, you will receive at maturity a payment that will not exceed the maximum settlement amount, regardless of the appreciation in the underlier, which may be significant. Accordingly, the amount payable on your notes may be significantly less than it would have been had you invested directly in the underlier. The maximum settlement amount is $1,192.00.\n\nThe Return on Your Notes May Change Significantly Despite Only a Small Change in the Level of the Underlier Below the Trigger Buffer Level\n\nIf the final underlier level is less than the trigger buffer level, you will receive less than the principal amount of your notes and you will lose all or a substantial portion of your investment in the notes. This means that while a decrease in the final underlier level to the trigger buffer level will not result in a loss of principal on the notes, a decrease in the final underlier level to less than the trigger buffer level will result in a loss of a significant portion of the principal amount of the notes despite only a small change in the level of the underlier.\n\nThe Notes Are Subject to the Credit Risks of JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThe notes are subject to our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s credit risks, and our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s credit ratings and credit spreads may adversely affect the market value of the notes. Investors are dependent on our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s ability to pay all amounts due on the notes. Any actual or potential change in our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s creditworthiness or credit spreads, as determined by the market for taking that credit risk, is likely to adversely affect the value of the notes. If we and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to default on our payment obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the notes and you could lose your entire investment.\n\nAs a Finance Subsidiary, JPMorgan Financial Has No Independent Operations and Has Limited Assets\n\nAs a finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., we have no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of our securities. Aside from the initial capital contribution from JPMorgan Chase & Co., substantially all of our assets relate to obligations of our affiliates to make payments under loans made by us or other intercompany agreements. As a result, we are dependent upon payments from our affiliates to meet our obligations under the notes. If these affiliates do not make payments to us and we fail to make payments on the notes, you may have to seek payment under the related guarantee\n\nby JPMorgan Chase & Co., and that guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nNo Interest or Dividend Payments or Voting Rights\n\nAs a holder of the notes, you will not receive interest payments. As a result, even if the amount payable for your notes on the stated maturity date exceeds the principal amount of your notes, the overall return you earn on your notes may be less than you would have earned by investing in a non-index-linked debt security of comparable maturity that bears interest at a prevailing market rate. In addition, as a holder of the notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the underlier stocks would have.\n\nWe May Sell an Additional Aggregate Principal Amount of the Notes at a Different Issue Price\n\nAt our sole option, we may decide to sell an additional aggregate principal amount of the notes subsequent to the date of this pricing supplement. The issue price of the notes in the subsequent sale may differ substantially (higher or lower) from the original issue price you paid as provided on the cover of this pricing supplement.\n\nIf You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to the Principal Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at the Principal Amount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected\n\nThe amount you will be paid for your notes on the stated maturity date will not be adjusted based on the price you pay for the notes. If you purchase notes at a price that differs from the principal amount of the notes, then the return on your investment in the notes held to the stated maturity date will differ from, and may be substantially less than, the return on notes purchased at the principal amount. If you purchase your notes at a premium to the principal amount and hold them to the stated maturity date the return on your investment in the notes will be lower than it would have been had you purchased the notes at the principal amount or a discount to the principal amount. In addition, the impact of the trigger buffer level and the cap level on the return on your investment will depend upon the price you pay for your notes relative to the principal amount. For example, if you purchase your notes at a premium to the principal amount, the cap level will permit only a lower percentage increase in your investment in the notes than would have been the case for notes purchased at the principal amount or a discount to the principal amount. Similarly, the trigger buffer level, while still providing an increase in the return on the notes if the final underlier level is greater than or equal to the trigger buffer level but less than the cap level, will allow a greater percentage decrease in your investment in the notes than would have been the case for notes purchased at the principal amount or a discount to the principal amount.\n\nLack of Liquidity\n\nThe notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. JPMS intends to offer to purchase the notes in the secondary market but is not required to do so. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which JPMS is willing to buy the notes.\n\nThe Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes Are Uncertain\n\nThere is no direct legal authority as to the proper U.S. federal income tax characterization of the notes, and we do not intend to request a ruling from the IRS. The IRS might not accept, and a court might not uphold, the treatment of the notes described in \"Key Terms -- Tax treatment\" in this pricing supplement and in \"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\" in the accompanying product supplement. If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the notes, the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could differ materially and adversely from our description herein. In addition, in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of \"prepaid forward contracts\" and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or\n\nloss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the \"constructive ownership\" regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the section entitled \"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\" in the accompanying product supplement and consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.\n\nWe and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the notes, including acting as calculation agent and as an agent of the offering of the notes, hedging our obligations under the notes and making the assumptions used to determine the pricing of the notes and the estimated value of the notes. Also, the distributor from which you purchase the notes may conduct hedging activities for us in connection with the notes. In performing these duties, our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s economic interests, the economic interests of any distributor performing such duties and the economic interests of the calculation agent and other affiliates of ours are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes. In addition, our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s business activities, and the business activities of any distributor from which you purchase the notes, including hedging and trading activities, could cause our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s economic interests to be adverse to yours and could adversely affect any payment on the notes and the value of the notes. It is possible that hedging or trading activities of ours or our affiliates in connection with the notes could result in substantial returns for us or our affiliates while the value of the notes declines. If the distributor from which you purchase notes is to conduct hedging activities for us in connection with the notes, that distributor may profit in connection with such hedging activities and such profit, if any, will be in addition to the compensation that the distributor receives for the sale of the notes to you. You should be aware that the potential to earn fees in connection with hedging activities may create a further incentive for the distributor to sell the notes to you in addition to the compensation they would receive for the sale of the notes. Please refer to \"Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest\" on page PS-17 of the accompanying product supplement for additional information about these risks.\n\nRisks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes\n\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes Is Lower Than the Original Issue Price of the Notes\n\nThe estimated value of the notes is only an estimate determined by reference to several factors. The original issue price of the notes exceeds the estimated value of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. See \"Summary Information -- The Estimated Value of the Notes\" on page PS-7 of this pricing supplement.\n\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes Does Not Represent Future Values of the Notes and May Differ from Others' Estimates\n\nThe estimated value of the notes is determined by reference to internal pricing models of our affiliates when the terms of the notes are set. This estimated value of the notes is based on market conditions and other relevant factors existing at that time and assumptions about market parameters, which can include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors. Different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the notes that are greater than or less than the estimated value of the notes. In\n\naddition, market conditions and other relevant factors in the future may change, and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect. On future dates, the value of the notes could change significantly based on, among other things, changes in market conditions, our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s creditworthiness, interest rate movements and other relevant factors, which may impact the price, if any, at which JPMS would be willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions. See \"Summary Information -- The Estimated Value of the Notes\" on page PS-7 of this pricing supplement.\n\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes Is Derived by Reference to an Internal Funding Rate\n\nThe internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may be based on, among other things, our and our affiliates' view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of JPMorgan Chase & Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes. See \"Summary Information -- The Estimated Value of the Notes\" on page PS-7 of this pricing supplement.\n\nThe Value of the Notes as Published by JPMS (and Which May Be Reflected on Customer Account Statements) May Be Higher Than the Then-Current Estimated Value of the Notes for a Limited Time Period\n\nWe generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. These costs can include selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, and, in some circumstances, estimated hedging costs and our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances. See \"Summary Information -- Secondary Market Prices of the Notes\" on page PS-8 of this pricing supplement for additional information relating to this initial period. Accordingly, the estimated value of your notes during this initial period may be lower than the value of the notes as published by JPMS (and which may be shown on your customer account statements).\n\nSecondary Market Prices of the Notes Will Likely Be Lower Than the Original Issue Price of the Notes\n\nAny secondary market prices of the notes will likely be lower than the original issue price of the notes because, among other things, secondary market prices take into account our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances and, also, because secondary market prices may exclude selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, and estimated hedging costs that are included in the original issue price of the notes. As a result, the price, if any, at which JPMS will be willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions, if at all, is likely to be lower than the original issue price. Any sale by you prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you. See the immediately following risk consideration for information about additional factors that will impact any secondary market prices of the notes.\n\nThe notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your notes to maturity. See \" -- Risks Relating to the Notes Generally -- Lack of Liquidity\" on page PS-14 of this pricing supplement.\n\nSecondary Market Prices of the Notes Will Be Impacted by Many Economic and Market Factors\n\nThe secondary market price of the notes during their term will be impacted by a number of economic and market factors, which may either offset or magnify each other, aside from the selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, estimated hedging costs and the level of the underlier, including:\n\nAdditionally, independent pricing vendors and/or third party broker-dealers may publish a price for the notes, which may also be reflected on customer account statements. This price may be different (higher or lower) than the price of the notes, if any, at which JPMS may be willing to purchase your notes in the secondary market.\n\nRisks Relating to the Underlier\n\nAn Investment in the Notes Is Subject to Risks Associated with Small Capitalization Stocks\n\nThe underlier stocks are issued by companies with relatively small market capitalization. The stock prices of smaller companies may be more volatile than stock prices of large capitalization companies. Small capitalization companies may be less able to withstand adverse economic, market, trade and competitive conditions relative to larger companies. Small capitalization companies are less likely to pay dividends on their stocks, and the presence of a dividend payment could be a factor that limits downward stock price pressure under adverse market conditions.\n\nTHE Underlier\n\nThe Russell 2000 Index consists of the middle 2,000 companies included in the Russell 3000E\u2122 Index and, as a result of the index calculation methodology, consists of the smallest 2,000 companies included in the Russell 3000 Index. The Russell 2000Index is designed to track the performance of the small capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. For additional information about the Russell 2000 Index, see the information set forth under \"Equity Index Descriptions -- The Russell Indices\" on page US-35 of the accompanying underlying supplement.\n\nIn addition, information about the Russell 2000 Index may be obtained from other sources, including, but not limited to, the underlier sponsor's website (including information regarding the underlier's (i) top ten constituent stocks and (ii) sector weights). We are not incorporating by reference into this pricing supplement the website or any material it includes. Neither we nor any agent or dealer for this offering makes any representation that this publicly available information regarding the underlier is accurate or complete.\n\nHistorical Closing Levels of the Underlier\n\nThe closing level of the underlier has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. Any historical upward or downward trend in the closing level of the underlier during any period shown below is not an indication that the underlier is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time during the term of your notes.\n\nYou should not take the historical levels of the underlier as an indication of the future performance of the underlier. We cannot give you any assurance that the future performance of the underlier or the underlier stocks will result in a return of any of your initial investment on the stated maturity date. In light of the increased volatility currently being experienced by the securities markets, and recent market declines, it may be substantially more likely that you could lose all or a substantial portion of your investment in the notes.\n\nNeither we nor any of our affiliates make any representation to you as to the performance of the underlier. The actual performance of the underlier over the term of the offered notes, as well as the amount payable at maturity, may bear little relation to the historical levels shown below.\n\nThe graph below shows the closing levels of the underlier on each day from January 2, 2019 through March 18, 2024. The closing level of the underlier on March 18, 2024 was 2,024.735. We obtained the closing levels shown above and in the graph below from the Bloomberg Professional service (\"Bloomberg\"), without independent verification.",

        "title": "Former Tesla Executive Joins General Motors to Drive Electric Vehicle Strategy",
        "body": "Newest hiring shows GM's commitment to competing in the EV market\n\nIn a sign that the company has set its sight on the electric car market, General Motors hired former Tesla executive JP Clausen as its new Executive Vice President of Global Manufacturing and Sustainability. Clausen is replacing Gerald Johnson, who is retiring after 44 years.\n\nDuring his tenure at Tesla from 2015-19, Clausen served as Vice President of the company's first battery manufacturing plant, working closely with CEO Elon Musk and former CTO JB Straubel. During his tenure, Tesla grew from a niche car manufacturer to the leader in electronic car production. He most recently worked at Google as a vice president of engineering for the company's Data Center Advanced Technology Innovation group.\n\nClausen's appointment isn't the only instance of former Tesla executives joining GM. Jon McNeill, former President of Global Sales and Service at Tesla, serves on GM's Board of Directors. Additionally, Kurt Kelty, who led Tesla's battery development for 11 years, recently joined GM as Vice President of Batteries.\n\nGM is counting on these Tesla alumni to bolster its competitiveness in the electric vehicle market. However, despite these strategic hires, there remains much ground to cover. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla captured 56% of all Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales in the country, indicating the significant lead it holds.\n\nStraubel's hiring wasn't the only shakeup in GM's executive ranks. Executive Vice President of Software and Services Mike Abbott announced his resignation due to health reasons. Baris Cetinok, currently Vice President of Products in Software and Services, will step in as his interim replacement while GM searches for a permanent successor.",

        "body": "In general, the General Motors Vortec 5.3-liter V8 is a powerful, dependable engine. If you're not familiar with General Motors' Vortec engines, they are a family of small-block V8s that GM put into wide use across its truck and SUV models starting in the mid-1990s. Built around vortex technology, which generated swirl inside the engine's combustion chamber to help the gasoline atomize, the Vortec line developed alongside General Motors' classic LS engines. While the Vortec and LS engines have several differences -- notably, Vortecs are cast-iron blocks while LSes are aluminum -- the primary difference was in application: GM branded their truck and SUV engines \"Vortec\" and kept the LS label for high-performance cars. Indeed, Vortecs and LS engines are similar enough to have interchangeable parts, making Vortecs popular for engine swaps.\n\nThere are a handful of 5.3-liter V8 engines in the Vortec family, and they are broken into two categories: Gen III and Gen IV. As a rule, Gen III is the superior plant. Buyers should be more wary of the Gen IV model.",

However, now the SDVerse would aim to improve efficiency by creating a digital space for businesses to buy and sell automotive software.\n\nAnd let me tell you, this is a needed sector. There is huge growth anticipated for the automotive software market. In fact, it could outgrow the available software development talent. The SDVerse therefore attempts to address this gap by connecting the wider pool of software solutions with automakers.\n\nIf you're interested in how this might affect the future of Magna stock and these other companies, there are points to consider. On the plus side, this could streamline the software supply chain. The need is clear, and this addresses the challenge of fragmented software development in the auto sector. Furthermore, it could also mean more growth in automotive software, with SDVerse providing a well-timed solution for connecting automakers with software. According to the press release, the automotive software market is expected to double this decade alone.\n\nBut there are some downsides, of course. There remains a lot of competition in the software field. While automakers might use SDVerse, it's likely many already have partnerships with software companies. Therefore, investors may want to wait and see to see how larger tech companies react to this new platform.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more, Magna stock and its partners will be hosting a panel to discuss the future of SDVerse on April 4, 2024. Until then, it might be best to sit on the sidelines to learn more about how the company plans to integrate its software with other businesses.\n\nOn the one hand, software connection could mean recurring revenue for the company. And that would be of huge importance. However, it's unclear how much such a venture might cost, and when these companies plan to see it turn a profit.\n\nWhat will likely need to happen is for there to be major partnerships with large tech companies as well as car manufacturers. If these companies sign up for using SDVerse, then this could cause share prices of all three companies to soar. But until that time comes, pay attention to more information come April 4.",

        "body": "Loading...Loading...\n\nApple Inc AAPL is facing criticism from tech giants Meta Platforms Inc META and Microsoft Corp MSFT over its compliance plan in the ongoing legal battle with Epic Games.\n\nWhat Happened: Apple's compliance with a 2021 order from a California federal judge, which prohibits the tech giant from restricting app developers from using external payment options, has been deemed inadequate by Meta, Microsoft, and other companies, reported The Verge on Wednesday.\n\nEpic and other developers have been dissatisfied with Apple's 15% to 30% fees on in-app purchases. Apple's restrictions on directing users to lower-priced payment options outside the iOS ecosystem have also been frustrating.\n\nSee Also: Apple Quietly Unveils New Multimodal AI With A Staggering 30B Parameters: Could It Power Text And Vision\n\nThe companies wrote in their brief, \"Apple's new restrictions are plainly designed to render alternatives to Apple's IAP impractical for developers and inaccessible and unappealing to consumers, thus circumventing both the spirit and underlying goals of the injunction.\"\n\nThe amici argues that Apple's 12% to 27% fee on external purchases undermines the new requirement's intent, as it offers only a marginal reduction compared to what developers would pay for in-app purchases.\n\nThis fee for external purchases might render it impractical for developers to establish such payment systems, especially considering additional transaction costs that could nullify the 3% savings from moving away from Apple's system. Furthermore, customers are unlikely to opt for the external option if it entails the same or higher prices.\n\nWhy It Matters: This development comes on the heels of Apple's recent actions in the European Union. In February, the company announced changes to its App Store to support alternative app stores in the EU.\n\nHowever, these changes have been met with skepticism, with Apple's Phil Schiller warning of potential privacy threats.\n\nIn March, Apple terminated Epic Games' developer account, preventing the introduction of the Epic Games Store and Fortnite on iOS devices in Europe. Epic Games condemned this move as violating the Digital Markets Act (DMA).\n\nApple's compliance plan in the Epic case is a crucial issue that could significantly impact the company's future dealings with developers and regulators.\n\nRead Next: Compute, Not Fiat Or Bitcoin, Will Be The 'Currency Of The Future,' Says Sam Altman As Nvidia's Jensen Huang Highlights $100 Trillion AI Opportunity\n\nPhoto by BigTunaOnline on Shutterstock\n\nEngineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh Bagalkote\n\nThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

        "body": "Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., X Corp. and Match Group Inc. asked a federal judge to reject Apple Inc.'s plan for opening its App Store to outside payment options.\n\nIn a rare joint filing, the companies said Apple's plan \"comports with neither the letter nor the spirit\" of a 2021 ruling which found iPhone maker in violation of California unfair competition laws and required it to allow app developers to direct users to their own payment systems.\n\nAlso read: iPhone 16 is set to redefine smartphone design with smaller bezels and larger displays, reveals report.\n\nEchoing arguments by Epic Games Inc. in its long-running antitrust fight with Apple over the App Store, the companies said Apple's plan \"imposes new restrictions on app developers that ensure the price competition that the injunction was designed to promote will never materialize.\"\n\nThe filing marks the latest volley in the back-and-forth over Apple's tight control over its app marketplace, which is one of the world's two dominant stores alongside Alphabet Inc.'s Google Play. An appeals court last year upheld the 2021 decision by an Oakland trial judge who found Apple's business model violated California law by limiting developers from communicating about their alternative payment systems, which could wind up costing users less. Apple takes a cut from every purchase made on its app store.\n\nEpic, maker of the popular Fortnite game, and Apple had both asked the Supreme Court to review the lower-court rulings, but the high court declined in January.\n\nApple said at the time it would let all third-party apps sold in the US include an outside link to a developer website to process payments for in-app purchases. But Epic last week asked for Apple to be held in contempt of court, claiming the company made outside links \"commercially unusable\" by imposing new fees.\n\nApple's plan -- which is nine pages and 2,900 words -- describes \"dozens of requirements and limitations to which developers must adhere to be eligible to include an external purchase link within their apps,\" according to the filing from Meta, Microsoft, X and Match.\n\nApple previously said it is complying with the court order while continuing to protect the privacy and security of its app store users.\n\nThough Apple is allowing app makers to include an outside link to alternative payment systems, the company is still attempting to collect a 12% or 27% revenue share from developers that opt out of the system.\n\nThe case is Epic Games Inc. v. Apple Inc., 20-cv-05640, US District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).",

        "body": "Mark Zuckerberg, the Chief Operating Officer and CEO of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), has recently made significant transactions involving the company's stock, according to a Form 4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On March 19, Zuckerberg sold shares worth more than $22 million.\n\nThe transactions included the sale of Class A Common Stock shares through two separate entities. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Foundation sold shares totaling approximately $16 million, with prices ranging from $482.3183 to $496.255. Furthermore, Mark Zuckerberg, Trustee of the Mark Zuckerberg Trust dated July 7, 2006, sold shares amounting to around $6.4 million, with prices varying between $482.6413 and $496.2416.\n\nIt's important to note that the reported prices are weighted average prices, and the shares were sold in multiple transactions at different prices within the specified ranges. The precise number of shares sold at each separate price within these ranges can be provided upon written request to the issuer, any security holder of the issuer, or the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nZuckerberg's actions reflect an ongoing plan as both sets of transactions were executed pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted on July 31, 2023. This type of plan allows insiders to sell shares over a predetermined period of time, reducing the potential for any accusations of trading on nonpublic information.\n\nWhile the sales were substantial, it should be noted that Zuckerberg still holds a significant number of Meta shares, both directly and indirectly, through various trusts and foundations. The transactions reported on this Form 4 filing provide a glimpse into the CEO's stock holdings and movements but do not necessarily indicate a change in his long-term commitment to the company.\n\nInvestors and market watchers often pay close attention to insider transactions as they can provide insights into an insider's view of the company's future prospects. However, such transactions are quite routine and can be motivated by a variety of personal financial planning strategies.\n\nAs Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) continues to navigate the dynamic tech landscape, investors are keeping a keen eye on the company's financial health and market performance. Recent data from InvestingPro provides a snapshot of Meta's standing in the market. With a robust market capitalization of approximately $1.29 trillion, Meta is a heavyweight in the tech industry. The company's P/E Ratio as of the last twelve months ending Q4 2023 stands at 30.68, which suggests that the stock is trading at a lower price relative to its near-term earnings growth, according to one of the InvestingPro Tips.\n\nMoreover, Meta's revenue growth has been impressive, with an increase of 15.69% over the last twelve months as of Q1 2023. This growth is indicative of the company's ability to expand its business and maintain a strong market position. Another noteworthy metric is the company's gross profit margin, which is at a high 80.72%, underscoring Meta's efficiency in managing its production and service costs relative to its revenues.\n\nInvestors considering Meta's stock will find additional insights with the numerous InvestingPro Tips available. For instance, Meta is highlighted as a prominent player in the Interactive Media & Services industry and its cash flows are recognized for sufficiently covering interest payments. For those looking for deeper analysis and more tips, including the company's liquidity position and valuation multiples, there are 16 additional InvestingPro Tips available at: https://www.investing.com/pro/META.

        "title": "Three Reasons That Make Comcast An Attractive Holding (NASDAQ:CMCSA)",
        "body": "Comcast is trading at a discount compared to its sector and historical valuation, making it an appealing investment opportunity.\n\nComcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), a leading telecommunications conglomerate, offers a range of services including cable television, internet, and phone services. With its headquarters in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Comcast serves millions of customers across the United States. The company is also a major player in the entertainment industry, owning NBCUniversal, which includes popular networks like NBC, CNBC, and Universal Pictures. Known for its reliable services and innovative technology, Comcast continues to expand its offerings to meet the evolving needs of consumers in the digital age.\n\nIn June 2022, we initiated coverage of the company with a buy rating, which we reaffirmed in October 2022. However, we have not offered any further updates on the company's performance since then, nor have we shared our outlook on its future financial performance. Therefore, the purpose of our current analysis is to provide this updated perspective and assess whether our previous recommendation to buy the stock still holds true.\n\nWe'll start our discussion by examining the financial performance of the previous quarter, focusing particularly on growth and profitability. Next, we'll evaluate the company's dedication to returning value to shareholders, which was a significant consideration in our previous analysis supporting our optimistic rating. Finally, we'll delve into the company's valuation, utilizing a range of conventional price multiples to gauge its current standing in the market.\n\nThe following table presents key financial data for Comcast for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022.\n\nRevenue: Comcast's revenue increased by 2.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. However, for the full year, revenue saw a marginal increase of 0.1%.\n\nNet Income Attributable to Comcast: Net income attributable to Comcast grew significantly by 7.8% in the fourth quarter and 186.5% for the full year of 2023 compared to the respective periods in 2022.\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted net income slightly decreased by 3.1% in the fourth quarter but increased by 2.1% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA remained relatively stable in the fourth quarter but increased by 3.2% for the full year.\n\nEarnings per Share (EPS): Earnings per share increased notably by 15.7% in the fourth quarter and significantly in the full year of 2023. Adjusted earnings per share also saw an increase, up by 2.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.3% for the full year.\n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities and Free Cash Flow: Net cash provided by operating activities increased slightly by 0.7% in the fourth quarter and significantly by 7.9% for the full year. Free cash flow increased notably by 28.5% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year.\n\nLet us take a more granular look at the results to see which segments have been the primary drivers of these results. Now, let us start examining the connectivity and platforms segment, and the content and experiences segment separately.\n\nThe following slide summarizes the results of the connectivity and platforms segment. Here, we would like to highlight that CMCSA's largest segment the residential connectivity and platforms has maintained a relatively stable revenue year-over-year, but more importantly the wireless business revenue has reached a record of over $1billion, while adding 310K wireless lines. The profitability of this segment has also increased as shown by the EBITDA margin improvement of 120 bps.\n\nWhen looking at the media segment, the following points are the key takeaways from the recent earnings release:\n\nThe decline in revenue due to the World Cup is a one-time effect, which will not impact the comparables in the coming quarters, and which does not serve as an indication for the general performance of the business. Therefore we put a smaller emphasis on this point.\n\nTurning our focus more towards the entertainment side and focusing on the firm's performance in the Studios segment, we can see that:\n\nHere we would like to underline the first bullet point. We believe that creating quality content that the viewers demand and like is the key to the success of this segment. The revenue rise indicates that CMCSA has done well in this regard. Looking forward, it is important that we understand that view preferences can rapidly change and content which is trendy now, may be outdated in a few months' time. For this reason, it is important to closely monitor how this segment is doing on a continuous basis.\n\nLast, but not least, the Theme Parks Segment:\n\nWe believe that this segment is the most dependent on consumer confidence. As consumer confidence has started to rebound in the recent months, we believe that the performance of this segment is also likely to gradually improve further, however, the improvement may take several quarters, as consumer confidence is normally a leading economic indicator.\n\nOverall, Comcast showed positive financial performance, with notable increases in net income, earnings per share, and cash flow metrics, indicating strong operational efficiency and financial health. Also, when looking at the profitability metrics of the firm in relation with its peers and competitors, we can see that CMCSA is one of the most attractive players in the cable and satellite industry, from a profitability perspective.\n\nFor these reasons, our bullish view remains intact based on the recent financial performance.\n\nOne of the primary reasons why we have been bullish on CMCSA's stock in our previous writing was their commitment to return value to shareholders.\n\nAnd our view has not changed in this regard. Comcast has kept on delivering attractive returns to its shareholders both in the form of dividend payments and through share buybacks. In the previous year alone, the firm has bought back $11 billion worth of shares and paid almost $5 billion in dividends. With the recent 6.9% dividend increase, the current annual dividend has reached $1.24 per share. This increase marks the 16 consecutive annual dividend increase.\n\nFor this reason, we believe CMCSA's stock remains attractive to dividend and dividend growth investors.\n\nTo assess the valuation of Comcast, we are going to take a look at a set of traditional price multiples. We will compare CMCSA's figures with those of the respective sector median and also with those of the firm's closest peers and competitors.\n\nBased on the table above, we can see that currently Comcast is trading at a significant discount compared to the communication services sector, according to most metrics. Moreover, CMCSA also appears to be cheap in comparison to its own historic valuation multiples. Considering the financial performance of the firm in the previous quarter, and its commitment to return value to its shareholders, we believe that this discount is not justified.\n\nIf we narrow down the comparison to CMCSA's closest peers and competitors, we can also see that the valuation is reasonable.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, we also believe that our previously established bullish view is justified. In our opinion, based on the above-discussed price multiples and the firm's financial performance/fundamentals, a P/E expansion is warranted. We expect a 20% to 25% upside at the current valuation, which would be in line with the firm's historic valuation over the past 5 years.\n\nBefore concluding our writing, we briefly have to highlight some risks that we believe are important for investors to keep in mind.\n\nComcast faces several key business risks, including increased competition in the telecommunications and media industries, which could erode market share and pricing power. Rapid technological advancements may require significant investments to stay competitive, impacting profitability. Content acquisition costs could continue to rise, potentially squeezing margins. Shifts in consumer preferences towards streaming services could lead to cord-cutting and declining revenue from traditional cable subscriptions. Additionally, economic downturns may reduce discretionary spending on entertainment services, adversely affecting Comcast's bottom line.\n\nComcast has sustained growth on both a quarterly and yearly basis. With a strong commitment to returning value through dividends and share buybacks, it remains an attractive option for dividend and dividend growth investors. Trading at a discount compared to its sector and its own historical valuation, Comcast presents an appealing investment opportunity. Therefore, we maintain our \"buy\" rating, believing the company will continue to perform well in the future.",

The green hydrogen production facility would be developed as part of Uniper's wider aspirations for the Killingholme Energy Transformation Hub.\n\nUniper and Phillips 66 Limited have signed a collaboration agreement to work together towards a supply of green hydrogen from the Humber H2ub\u00ae (Green) project to Phillips 66 Limited's Humber Refinery from 2029. The hydrogen would be used to replace refinery fuel gas in industrial-scale fired heaters, as part of Phillips 66 Limited's plans to reduce the Humber Refinery's scope 1 operational emissions.\n\nHydrogen production is a key pillar of Uniper's strategy, and our aim is to build more than 1 GW of electrolyser capacity across the business by 2030.\n\nThe Humber H2ub\u00ae (Green) project development and the supply agreement with Phillips 66 Limited are subject to financial investment approval from Uniper's and Phillips 66 Limited's management, and several pre-conditions that would have to be satisfied; including securing the necessary planning consents and environmental permit, agreement on terms for the hydrogen offtake and a Low Carbon Hydrogen Agreement with the UK Government.\n\nGuy Phillips, Team Lead, Business Development Hydrogen, UK for Uniper, said: \"The Humber H2ub\u00ae (Green) project is a key part of Uniper's hydrogen ambitions in the UK and we're pleased to be collaborating on it with Phillips 66 Limited.

It has the potential to support the UK's hydrogen and decarbonisation ambitions, creating new high-skilled employment opportunities and ensuring the site continues to make a valuable contribution to the regional economy.\"\n\nDuncan Hammond, Humber's Decarbonisation Projects Manager at Phillips 66 Limited, shared: \"We are excited to collaborate with Uniper on their low carbon hydrogen project. Hydrogen refuelling will be a big step in lowering the refinery's emissions as we evolve with the energy transition. Energy security is vital for the UK.Utilising technologies such as low carbon hydrogen produced by electrolysis and also carbon capture will enable us to continue to produce essential products for the transport sector and supply chain, some of which are used in the production of electric vehicle batteries, wind turbine blades, pharmaceuticals and much more.\n\nWe believe hydrogen will attract new industry, protect jobs, and develop the local economy.\"",

At the same time, the Dow added 1.03%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.25%.\n\nThe oil refiner's shares have seen an increase of 11.23% over the last month, surpassing the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 5.25% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.56%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Phillips 66 in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on April 26, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.60, reflecting a 38.24% decrease from the same quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $31.68 billion, showing a 9.73% drop compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nPSX's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $12.55 per share and revenue of $133.87 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -20.62% and -10.69%, respectively.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Phillips 66. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 4.77% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Phillips 66 is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Phillips 66's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 12.51. This represents no noticeable deviation compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 12.51.\n\nWe can also see that PSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.08. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.93.\n\nThe Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 84, positioning it in the top 34% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\n\nIt's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\n\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Rising altcoins, with their potential for explosive growth and exceptional ROIs. Coins with a long track record often give investors a sense of security.The potential promise of high returns usually lie with newcomers.\n\nThis article will discuss three emerging projects, Scorpion Casino (SCORP), Smog (SMOG), and Dogecoin20 (DOGE20), to assess their unique value propositions and potential for delivering substantial returns. By dissecting each project's fundamentals and long-term vision, we aim to empower investors to make informed decisions as they navigate the dynamic landscape of emerging altcoins.\n\nScorpion Casino Is Having A Whale Of A Time\n\nForget the ordinary online casino experience.

What am I supposed to do?\"\n\n\"All of Targets self-checkout lanes are now '10 items or less' hahaha go f**k yourself,\" wrote another.\n\n\"If b***ha** Target is being strict about 10 items or less at self-checkout then the least these lazy ass mfs can do is open the registers instead of having ONE cashier DAMN,\" shared another user.\n\nAccording to a factsheet released on March 14 confirming that Target would be switching all self-checkouts to express lanes, the retailer intends to open more registers.\n\n\"Checking out is one of the most important moments of the Target run, and we know that a fast, easy experience -- whether at self-checkout or the lanes staffed by our friendly team members -- is critical to getting guests on their way quickly,\" representatives wrote.\n\nIn the name of speed, the retailer claimed to be opening more lanes attended to by employees.\n\n\"We're opening more traditional lanes staffed by our team members across all our stores for guests who have more in their Target carts, need a helping hand, or just enjoy connecting with our team to help them get on their way sooner,\" the statement continued.\n\nThree days into the new express lane rollout and customers have not seen this smooth transition to more \"traditional\" lanes.\n\n\"When they make the self-checkout 10 items or less only but only have one Checkout Cashier for everyone else. @Target GET IT TOGETHER!\" wrote an angered customer on X.\n\n\"Might as well just remove self-checkout altogether since they started closing them down during certain times of the day, and now you can only use them if you have 10 items or less. So you have to wait in line even if a self-checkout is open. Idiotic,\" added another.\n\n\"My issue with target is if you are going to get rid of self-checkout you need more than 3 checkout isles open,\" criticized a third.\n\nTarget has been dealing with shoplifting occurrences that eating into its bottom line.\n\nCEO Brian Cornell announced that shrinkage, loss of profit due to product loss (theft), was putting \"significant pressure\" on the company's finances in mid-2023.\n\nHe warned that if the pattern continued, the company's profitability could reduce by over $500 million compared to prior year's figures.\n\nIn 2022, the retailer saw a reduction in profit of $700 million due to theft.\n\nFigures from May 2023 showed that Target stood to loose $1.2 billion from shrinkage in the next two years.\n\nThe Target CEO went on to warn that higher rates of \"violent incidents\" are putting staff and customers at risk, as well as the company's future.\n\nIn an earnings call, Cornell said, \"The unfortunate fact is, violent incidents are increasing at our stores and across the entire retail industry.\n\nBeyond violence, the bottom line is that theft is impacting customers in a variety of ways, from safety to item cost and availability.\n\n\"When products are stolen, simply put, they're no longer available for guests who depend on them.\n\n\"And left unchecked, theft and organized retail crime degrade the communities we call home.\"\n\nIn order to limit theft and increase safety, Target has implemented various new measures including \"significant resource investments,\" related to security.\n\nCornell noted that stores have increased security measures including installing more fixtures to protect produce and \"adjusting our assortment in affected stores.\"",

After peaking at 7.79% in late October, rates steadily declined until mid-January when they reversed course and began marching back up.\n\nFED LEAVES RATES UNCHANGED, SAYS THREE CUTS STILL PLANNED\n\nRates have fallen slightly for the past few weeks, but economists do not expect them to drop significantly any time soon. Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, said last week, \"In this environment, there is a good possibility that rates will stay higher for a longer period of time.\"\n\n\"The housing market is likely to continue to face the dual affordability constraints of high home prices and elevated interest rates in 2024,\" Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae senior vice president and chief economist, said in a statement announcing the increase in mortgage rate expectations.\n\nTO RENT OR TO BUY? WHAT TO CONSIDER WHEN DECIDING BETWEEN A HOUSE OR APARTMENT\n\n\"Hotter-than-expected inflation data and strong payroll numbers are likely to apply more upward pressure to mortgage rates this year than we'd previously forecast, as markets continue to evolve their expectations of future monetary policy,\" Duncan explained.\n\n\"Still,\" he added, \"while we don't expect a dramatic surge in the supply of homes for sale, we do anticipate an increase in the level of market transactions relative to 2023 - even if mortgage rates remain elevated.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFannie Mae said the change to its mortgage rate outlook was the principal driver of a downward revision to its total home sales forecast. The organization now expects 4.91 million home sales in 2024, down from 5 million, and 5.4 million sales in 2025, down from 5.54 million.",

        "title": "Fannie Mae's CEO says the housing market hasn't killed the American Dream yet. Buying a home 'might just take a little longer'",
        "body": "\"The American dream is still very much alive. It might just take a little longer,\" the former JPMorgan exec told Fortune this week.\n\nAlmodovar runs the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), which was created during the Great Depression to expand the secondary mortgage market. Today, the government-sponsored enterprise holds one-in-four U.S. mortgages and $4.3 trillion in total assets. Fannie Mae doesn't actually provide mortgages to consumers, instead they buy them from lenders and then repackage them into mortgage-backed securities which they sell to investors. This provides liquidity for the housing market, as Almodovar explained.\n\nBut despite Fannie Mae's efforts to boost the housing market, Almodovar noted that \"affordability is an issue\" for consumers today. She still believes there is a path to home ownership for the average American in spite of this, but it won't be easy.\n\nThe CEO recommended consumers that are frustrated with current market conditions work to improve their credit, and wait for an opportunity with the prospect of interest rate cuts on the horizon. \"There's a lot you can do in the meantime. Just get smart about what it is to be a homeowner and save and it'll happen,\" she said.\n\nAlmodovar went on to explain that her two \"strategic objectives\" at Fannie Mae are figuring out how to make the housing market \"more fair and more sustainable,\" including by offering a new way for renters to build credit and qualify for mortgages. \"Before, if you were a renter in this country, your rent did not count [toward your credit score],\" she explained. \"Through technology, Fannie Mae is taking that credit risk. If the consumer shows us their bank statements, we can tell what probably is a rent payment, the regularity of that payment, and we can make that consumer eligible.\"\n\nAlmodovar noted that over 500,000 rental units are reporting rent payments today, which is helping renters build sufficient credit to qualify for mortgages.\n\nStill, despite this new program and Almodovar's optimistic outlook on the American Dream, the average American isn't buying their first home until they turn 36 due to sky-high home prices and mortgage rates. Compared to baby boomers, who managed to buy their first homes by an average age of 29 in 1981, the American Dream has been delayed significantly for millennials and Gen Z.\n\nAnd Almodovar admitted that owning a home is one of the keys to what most Americans believe makes a \"good life.\" She even referenced how her immigrant parents bought their first home when she was growing up and it \"changed the trajectory\" of their lives.\n\n\"At my kitchen table, I heard, like probably many American families do today, talk about a good job, education...and saving for a home,\" she said. \"I still remember when I was five years old, they bought their first home. I remember the first night I slept in my room. And I think that's informed a lot of what I do.\"\n\nDespite understanding just how critical homeownership is to the American Dream, Almodovar argued that renting is a solid option right now. \"A third of households are renters, and I grew up as a renter, so my bias is that being a renter is fine,\" she said.\n\nEven though homeownership is still the number one way Americans build wealth, and most Americans will say it's a necessary feature of a \"good life,\" Almodovar argued that the perception of renting should change.\n\n\"I do believe millennials still want to be homeowners to raise a family, but it's not the only way,\" she said. \"Being a renter, if you have a stable, affordable home, you have roots in your community as well.\"",

        "body": "In a sign of how expectations can shift suddenly in the mortgage industry, Fannie Mae by 0.5 percentage points in its March housing and economic outlook.\n\nNot only that, but rates will not fall below 6% in 2025, according to the government-sponsored enterprise's forecast.\n\n\" and strong payroll numbers are likely to apply more upward pressure to mortgage rates this year than we'd previously forecast, as markets continue to evolve their expectations of future monetary policy,\" Chief Economist Doug Duncan said in a press release. \"Still, while we don't expect a , we do anticipate an increase in the level of market transactions relative to 2023 -- even if mortgage rates remain elevated.\"\n\nThose factors have the market now expecting the Federal Open Market Committee, meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, to hold off on any short-term rate reductions until later this year.\n\nThat in turn is impacting the 10-year Treasury yield, which led Duncan to raise his fourth quarter 2024 rate forecast to 6.4% from 5.9%. For the same period next year, he now sees rates at 6%, versus 5.7%.\n\nThe 10-year yield was at 4.31% at noon on March 19; the yield was as low as 3.82% on Feb. 1.\n\nDuncan reduced his 2024 originations outlook to $1.76 trillion from $1.91 trillion in the February forecast, with originations reduced to $1.37 trillion from $1.46 trillion. Refinance volume is now expected to come in at $397 billion from $459 billion. Fannie Mae estimated that total volume in 2023 was $1.47 trillion, with $1.22 trillion coming from home purchase originations.\n\nIn 2025, Fannie Mae now expects $2.18 trillion of volume, versus $2.36 trillion one month ago.\n\nSeparately, mortgage applications for newly constructed homes increased 15.7% year-over-year and by 1% month-to-month in February, the Mortgage Bankers Association said. The numbers from its Builder Application Survey are not seasonally adjusted.\n\nRising rates actually hampered activity during the month, but a competitive market kept volume up, said Joel Kan, deputy chief economist, in a press release.\n\n\"The average loan size increased to its highest level at almost $406,000, but it was still below the record high in MBA's survey of more than $436,000 in April 2022,\" said Kan. \"The Federal Housing Administration share of purchase applications, which provides a read on first-time homebuyer activity, increased to 25.7%, indicating that first-time buyers continue to turn to new homes due to the lack of affordable existing home options.\"\n\nNew single-family home sales were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 689,000 units, down 1.6% from January's pace of 700,000 units. Unadjusted, an estimated 62,000 new home sales occurred in February, down 1.6% from 63,000 the prior month.\n\nBesides the FHA share at 25.7%, conventional loans made up 63.9% of the volume, Department of Veterans Affairs comprised 10.1%, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture program just 0.3%.\n\nMeanwhile, the FHA made it official -- This is the first increase in 15 years, but it won't be the last, as the agency promised to recalculate the limits annually to keep pace with home price changes.\n\nStarting March 29, the limits are $105,532 for a single-section manufactured home and $193,719 for a multisection dwelling. The lot loan limit is $43,377.\n\n\"Updating the Title I loan limits was the next critical piece in our ongoing efforts to make the Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program work for lenders and homebuyers for whom manufactured housing offers an affordable way to meet their housing needs,\" said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon in a press release. \"We hope these changes will prompt more lenders to consider using the Title I program to meet the financing needs of consumers purchasing or refinancing manufactured homes.\"\n\nManufactured housing is seen by advocates as a tool to relieve the inventory shortage.\n\nThat shortage has kept home prices elevated. But the February report from First American Data & Analytics found that while prices increased 6.3% year-over-year, it was the slowest annual pace since October 2023.\n\nThe increase from January was 0.7%.\n\nThe second consecutive decline in the monthly pace clarifies the trajectory for price movements, First American Chief Economist Mark Fleming said.\n\n\"In February, our preliminary estimate of annualized appreciation dropped by almost a full percentage point,\" Fleming said in a press release. \"The last time there was a slow-down of this magnitude was in early 2023 when the Fed was aggressively raising interest rates.\"\n\nWhile indications are that the supply of homes for sale is on the rise, inflation is keeping prices elevated, he said.\n\nStill, \"the relative increase in homes for sale is a welcome sign for prospective home buyers and seems to be helping to normalize house-price appreciation, an added benefit heading into the spring home-buying season,\" Fleming said.",

        "body": "CLARK, Philippines - Global logistics leader UPS (NYSE: UPS) has taken the value of its investment commitments in Asia Pacific to over $250m since the start of 2023. The investments include the company's recent agreement with The Luzon International Premiere Airport Development Corporation (LIPAD) to expand its operations at Clark Airport (CRK) in the Philippines. The move will enable UPS to further strengthen its portfolio of integrated express, supply chain and healthcare logistics services.\n\n\"Asia Pacific continues to be one of UPS's fastest growing regions. UPS has continued to invest in our network to maximize speed and flexibility, build solutions addressing the shift of global trade lanes, and offer resilience for our customers,\" said Wilfredo Ramos, president, UPS Asia Pacific.\n\nThe agreement is the latest in a series of recent network and facility enhancements the company has made across Asia Pacific including in Singapore, Japan, China, Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan, and most recently Hong Kong, where UPS announced it will open a new state-of-the-art facility by 2028.\n\n\"We have been doing business in our Philippines hub for more than 25 years, helping to connect businesses to markets in Asia Pacific and beyond.

LIPAD, which operates Clark International Airport, looks forward to welcoming UPS to its future location in Clark and supports its expansion in the Philippines,\" Yap continued.\n\nConstruction of the new Clark hub is set to begin in February 2025, and it is expected to be operational in late 2026.\n\nAbout UPS\n\nUPS (NYSE: UPS) is one of the world's largest companies, with 2023 revenue of $91.0 billion, and provides a broad range of integrated logistics solutions for customers in more than 200 countries and territories.

        "title": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights United Parcel Service, GXO Logistics and FedEx",
        "body": "Chicago, IL - March 20, 2024 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses United Parcel Service UPS, GXO Logistics GXO and FedEx FDX.\n\nIndustry: Air Freight & Cargo\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2242902/2-air-freight-cargo-stocks-to-watch-despite-industry-woes\n\nA weaker-than-expected demand environment is hurting the prospects of participants in the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry. The slowdown of economic growth and supply-chain woes are creating additional headwinds.\n\nDespite the above-mentioned challenges, we believe that the space still has fuel left in the tank, especially for operators that target growth opportunities and operating efficiency initiatives. Even though economies are reopening, consumers' thirst for online shopping is rampant. Industry players' cost-cutting efforts to drive their bottom lines are commendable as well. In view of these favorable developments surrounding the space, we advise investors to focus on United Parcel Service and GXO Logistics.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe companies housed in the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry provide air delivery and freight services. Most players in the space are involved in offering specialized transportation and logistics services. Some participants offer a range of supply-chain solutions, such as freight forwarding, customs brokerage, fulfillment, returns, financial transactions and repairs. The well-being of the companies in this industrial cohort is directly proportional to the health of the economy.\n\nLeading industry players, including UPS and FedEx, transport millions of packages each day across the globe. Apart from operating a ground fleet of multiple vehicles, some of these companies maintain an air fleet. Moreover, some industry participants focus on providing air transportation services for passengers and cargo.\n\n4 Key Trends to Watch in the Transportation-Air Freight & Cargo Industry\n\nPersistent Demand Erosion - A Grave Concern: Due to the decline in shipping demand, particularly in Asia and Europe, volumes are being hurt. The weak demand scenario has led to a decrease in the volume of packages shipped. Lackluster volumes are hurting the results of key industry players like FDX. Evidently, FDX reported lower-than-expected earnings and revenues in second-quarter fiscal 2024 mainly due to demand woes. Weak demand for cargo aircraft is another bane.\n\nE-commerce Still a Force to Reckon With: It is hardly surprising that the pace of growth of e-commerce demand has slowed from the levels witnessed at the peak of the pandemic with the reopening of economies. However, it remains impressive, driven by the convenience associated with online shopping. The race to digitization also supports the momentum in e-commerce growth. E-commerce demand strength should continue to aid growth of the industry players.\n\nEconomic Uncertainty Remains Worrisome: Even though inflation in the United States has declined sharply, it remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Due to the hotter-than-expected January inflation reading, consumer sentiment took a beating. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey displayed a reading of 76.9 in February, down from the January figure of 79.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell's recent statement that he needs to \"see a little bit more data\" before rate cuts become reality highlights that interest rates will remain high, at least in the short term. Higher interest rates rise borrowing costs, escalating the chances of an economic slowdown. Rising inflation can turn markets more volatile in the coming days. Rising economic uncertainty does not bode well for stocks in this industry.\n\nSupply-Chain Disruptions - Another Bane: Although economic activities picked up from the pandemic gloom, supply-chain disruptions continue to dent stocks in the industry. Increased fuel and labor costs are also limiting bottom-line growth.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #237. This rank places it in the bottom 6% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are becoming pessimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimates for 2024 have gone down 18.2% year over year.\n\nDespite the dim near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it is worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Lags S&P 500 and Sector\n\nThe Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite and the broader Transportation sector over the past year.\n\nThe industry has slipped 7.2% over this period against the S&P 500's growth of 29.4% and the broader sector's appreciation of 11.5%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), a commonly used multiple for valuing Transportation-Air Freight and Cargo stocks, the industry is currently trading at 10.29X compared with the S&P 500's 14.72X. It is also lower than the sector's trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA of 11.44X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 13.58X, as low as 6.64X and at the median of 9.6X.\n\n2 Transportation-Air Freight and Cargo Stocks to Keep Tabs On\n\nBoth companies mentioned below presently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nUPS: We are appreciative of the company's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Robust free cash flow generation by UPS is another major positive and is leading to an uptick in shareholder-friendly activities.\n\nEven though the demand for online shopping has slowed down from the pandemic peak with the reopening of the economy, the figures are still higher than the pre-pandemic levels. UPS's earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, the average beat being 1.38%.\n\nGXO Logistics: The company is gaining from rapid growth of e-commerce, automation and outsourcing. GXO's efforts to strengthen logistics capabilities also bode well.\n\nThe company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, the average beat being 9.08%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GXO's 2024 earnings is pegged at $2.79 per share, indicating a 7.7% rise from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nJoin us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/ Zacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "How Lowe's loyalty program is the 'spine' for personalization efforts",
        "body": "Head of marketing Jen Wilson detailed the insights behind the retailer's latest campaign and partnerships with Google and Meta around its retail media network.\n\nLowe's today (March 21) rolled out MyLowe's Rewards nationwide with an accompanying advertising campaign that pitches the loyalty program to DIY consumers preparing to spruce up their homes this spring. The wide launch and campaign come amid a confluence of factors, including a stagnant housing market and persistent inflation, that has millennial consumers focused on home improvement, especially with nearly two-thirds of homeowners locked in at mortgage rates below 4%.\n\nMyLowe's Rewards, which was launched in January in select markets, seeks to engage consumers with a variety of perks and benefits, plus 5% savings for purchases made with the retailer's relaunched credit card. The program was also cited by Chairman, President and CEO Marvin Ellison as lending a potential \"flywheel effect\" that could increase DIY loyalty and demand over time after a tough Q4 that could be a harbinger of things to come.\n\nIn an interview with Marketing Dive, Jen Wilson, the company's senior vice president for enterprise brand and marketing, delved into the insights behind the program, how it will be integrated into the brand's marketing and how recently announcement partnerships with Google and Meta are expected to boost Lowe's retail media network.\n\nThe following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nJEN WILSON: The positioning of the entire program ... was really all around designing toward a millennial homeowner at the center. Millennial homeowners, in particular, whether it's stretching from new homeowners in their first home to homeowners who are more mature with children, have needs and wants for their home. When we qualitatively talk to them, those needs and wants became a throughline for how we thought about positioning both the program and the campaign.\n\nThe underpinning is, \"I have things that my home needs to run on a daily basis\" like air filters, lights and cleaning supplies, but also \"I have these ambitions for what I want my home to be someday,\" whether it's remodeling or refreshing something or even just simply adding new furniture to a backyard patio. We wanted you to be able to earn points every time that you're making purchases on the things that your home needs, and then receive MyLowe's Money back in exchange for those points so that you could use them on the things that you really want for your home.\n\nAs we think about the demands or needs of the millennial, they also were telling us that they like added perks and benefits, whether it's personalized promotions, which we know is not new to the industry, but it's important. Nevertheless, free gifts was a really important part of what we brought forward... Anytime that we do a kid's workshop or we do have a free plant for mom for Mother's Day, that's one of the fastest-selling experiences that we offer our consumers.\n\nWILSON: One of the things that we've also introduced as a part of the rollout -- and this came from a lot of our qualitative studies -- was that consumers do like this notion of what I would call affinity groups. Within the industry, we might call them cohorts or audience aggregation, but consumers see it as, \"Hey, I have these preferences that I want to tell you about, and by the way, you can incent me when I tell you about about them. So give me extra points, if I tell you more about myself.\" So there's some gamification.\n\nWe have a point booster offer with our launch for pet lovers, for first-time homeowners, for decorators, etc. We've seen a lot of consumers engaging with that, not just to take their free points for engaging with it, but also telling us what their preferences are.\n\nThat becomes the spine of exactly how you can get into both more personalized offers, but more personalized information... we can start to serve up the right products, the right services, the right offerings and the right offers to be able to speak to you in a way that we know is meaningful. This is most certainly the spine for how we will become more personalized in our conversations with our consumers. Affinity groups is one way, and there will be other ways that we'll unlock in the future, as well.\n\nWILSON: It's two parallel paths. The first path is a standalone, 360-degree campaign, everything from TV, radio, digital, social -- the whole bit. That's a big undertaking and it's a nice investment that we're making to launch this program across the full year. If the first lane is a standalone campaign, then the second piece is integration. Loyalty has to be integrated into all that you do as a company. [No matter the effort] I want to make sure that there's still a nod to the fact that we want you to be able to join, earn and save.\n\nBetween those two parallel paths, MyLowe's Rewards, particularly on the consumer side, will be a part of everything that we do and say. You will feel that from advertising all the way down to the store associate who's helping you checkout or find the product that you're looking for. Our associates have been fully trained and fully immersed in this program to support its launch and sustainment.\n\nWILSON: I'm so proud of the progress that we've made with our media network. The last time we talked we were in-housing and now we've fully stood-up the in-housing and the way that we are going to market with the network. The value that we're providing to our advertisers is so significant as we are scaling it.\n\nFirst, we're being an insights-driven retail media network and making sure that we're able to, with closed-loop reporting, understand exactly how consumers are reacting to the advertising we're putting out there. Not only being able to provide that measurement back to our advertisers, but to then pivot against the advertising, because when we're getting real-time insights, we cannot only say, \"Hey, here's how the campaign worked over seven weeks,\" but we can optimize that campaign within real time and get even more value for our advertisers. That really speaks to the partnership with Meta: let's make sure that we're driving all of these insights in real time, so that we can update our campaigns in real time and get a better yield for our advertisers.\n\nOn the second piece, we're expanding our off-site advertising capabilities with Google. It may be a little different from a Walmart or an Amazon where they're getting perhaps even more on-site traffic because they have a bigger consumable, CPG business. We have a bit of a different balance at Lowe's, because a home improvement shopper is not going to come as frequently as they might to a grocer, as an example. The ability to then use off-site [advertising] so we can drive more frequency in our go-to-market is really important. The fact that we are partnering with Google and opening up search ads is a really important piece of how we're expanding our network for for off-site capabilities.",

        "body": "National Bank of Serbia (NBS) Governor Jorgovanka Tabakovic and her team held talks in Belgrade with international investors at a meeting organized by the Bank of America, as part of their visit to Western Balkan countries.\n\nThe Governor pointed out that Serbia's long-term successful cooperation with international investors is one of the prerequisites for the country's further sustainable growth and success.\n\nShe assessed that the trust they have shown with their investment over a number of years obliges Serbia to exercise further responsibility, prudence in its approach and in running the domestic economy, as well as to continue to ensure a certain, safe and stable investment environment.\n\n\"It is noticeable that, over the past years, Serbia is increasingly present in the analyses and reports of international analysts, and the messages sent to investors about the advantages of investing in Serbian assets provide strong support and are 'our voice in the world.' When the second largest American bank points out that 'Serbian bonds shine,' reputable foreign media outlets report it and many investors read it, it is a confirmation for us that we are doing a good job,\" said Tabakovic.\n\nShe said Serbia has achieved record results in many areas, such as the highest inflow of foreign direct investments so far, record-high goods and services exports, record-high foreign exchange and gold reserves, constantly and dynamically growing dinar savings, as well as the lowest current account deficit relative to GDP and a record low unemployment rate.\n\nThe NBS said in a press release that international investors rest assured that inflation is on a certain, now eleven-month downward path and that in the coming period it is expected to further calm down towards the target band and the midpoint of 3 percent, which will also lead to a gradual easing of domestic monetary conditions.\n\nIt said the NBS will continue to apply a responsible and cautious approach in conducting its monetary policy, using all the instruments at its disposal and the flexibility of its own monetary framework.\n\nAccording to the investors' assessment, Serbia already greatly exceeds the current level of credit rating and deserves its upgrade to an investment grade, at which it is already valued by market participants, said the press release.\n\n\"Now that we are just a step away from investment grade, we are working more focused than ever on the goal of Serbia getting that rating level, which should result in even bigger investments and the expansion of the investor base, i.e. Serbia would be positioned even better on the global investment map, in terms of foreign direct and portfolio investment. The support we have from the international investment community is one of the key elements on that path,\" Tabakovic concluded.",

        "body": "Senior executives and company directors will be held accountable for the results of decisions made by generative AI models, and should avoid rushing out products based on new and untested technology, a top Bank of America (BoA) strategist has warned.\n\nHaim Israel, global strategist and head of global thematic research at BoA was in Dublin yesterday to speak at the American Chamber of Commerce annual conference, held at Croke Park.\n\nGenerative AI (Gen AI) will potentially add $16trn a year to global output and is likely, over time, to boost employment - but senior executives need to be alert to the speed of change and the potential pitfalls, he said.\n\n\"We (at Bank of America) are big believers that this is one of the biggest changes ever seen, and will apply to every industry over time,\" he told the Irish Independent ahead of the conference.\n\n'There will be two kinds of companies - ones that use Gen AI and ones that no longer exist'\n\nHowever, he said firms rushing to deploy products while the technology is in its infancy are taking huge risks.\n\n\"The Gen AI models today are still training, they are still drawing on - in some cases - false data or incomplete data, and that creates what we call 'hallucinations',\" he said.\n\nThose 'hallucinations' mean a Gen AI model will generate distorted predictions, based on its logical processing of incomplete or false data.\n\n\"You need to think of this as the very early stages of a revolution - so if I rush to implementation and start coming up with products, I'm exposing myself to this false data,\" he said.\n\n\"If decisions are taken based on Gen AI, there is a legal liability - but it remains with the people taking the decisions to use the models.\"\n\nHe pointed to the particular legal risks of deploying Gen AI in sectors such as medicine and banking - two of the most data-rich industries globally, but also two of the most highly regulated sectors.\n\nWhile he cautioned against rushing to ship products, he said businesses need to be working on solutions now - so they can be in position to exploit the technology when it can be used on scale in coming years.\n\n\"In three or four years, there will be two kinds of companies - ones that use Gen AI and ones that no longer exist,\" he said. \"You have to start the work today to be in position to implement, once things like accurate models and a regulatory framework are in place.\n\n\"There are some products coming to market, but we'd see this as very early days - and anyone putting a toe in the water needs to do it very cautiously.\"\n\nOne thing that must be considered is who bears responsibility for the outcomes, he said.\n\nGen AI will transform industries and will result in a likely significant jobs upheaval. He compared the likely impact to the rollout of ATMs in the banking sector.\n\nWhile it raised fears over jobs, especially among cashiers, the impact over time was to increase employment, as banks were able to shift into higher-value-added activities.\n\nHowever, the pace of change under Gen AI may mean large-scale job losses come well ahead of future growth in new jobs-rich areas, creating a potentially big social impact, he noted.",

        "body": "A San Diego biotech is working on therapies that could tackle life-altering conditions, like autoimmune diseases and cancer, by modifying cells. But instead of engineering cells in a lab, they're doing it inside your body.\n\nThanks to that novel approach and the support of some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry, Capstan Therapeutics has netted $175 million in a fundraising round, despite a sluggish venture capital environment for startups. La Jolla-based Capstan, which made the announcement Wednesday, exceeded its fundraising goal of $125 million in a Series B round led by RA Capital Management.\n\nThe firm explained that it is employing the cutting-edge messenger-RNA technology that made the COVID-19 vaccine possible and marrying it with the science behind cell therapy.\n\n\"If it weren't for cell therapy, Capstan wouldn't exist. If it weren't for the COVID-19 vaccine, Capstan wouldn't exist. It's almost like the two had a baby and they created Capstan,\" said Laura Shawver, the company's president and CEO.\n\nShe said the company is working on a cheaper and less complex multi-step process for getting essential therapies to more patients.\n\nBeyond the major funding, Capstan boasts backing from more than a handful of big pharma companies such as Johnson & Johnson Innovation (JJDC), Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, Leaps by Bayer, Novartis Venture Fund and Pfizer Ventures.\n\nCapstan was founded in 2021 and has raised $340 million to date. The scientific research behind Capstan came out of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIts founders are pioneers of CAR-T cell technology, which has led to revolutionary therapies that modify immune system cells, or T-cells, in a lab to help a patient's body target and destroy disease causing cells, like cancer.\n\nCapstan is developing therapies that modulate unhealthy cells inside the body -- rather than editing the cells outside of the body -- through RNA delivery methods.\n\nShawver explained that while CAR-T cell therapies have proven effective, they are not widely accessible to most patients and they are costly. It requires the extraction of samples from patients, external manufacturing, and then the patients have to undergo chemotherapy to prepare their bodies for the integration of the cell therapy.\n\n\"It's just impractical to get it to most people,\" Shawver said. \"So as a result, a number of companies are trying in vivo (inside the body) approaches to deliver directly to T-cells that can then fight the diseases once they're engineered in the body.\n\n\"This is why our industry needs to have a different approach so that we can bring it forward to more people in an easier way.\"\n\nCapstan encodes mRNA, packages it in a lipid nanoparticle that is \"decorated\" with an antibody, which directs the body's T-cells to attack problematic cells.\n\nThere are broad applications for this platform technology, Shawver said, but right now Capstan is looking at ways to treat cancer, fibrosis, and autoimmune and genetic blood disorders.\n\nIn essence, its lead therapy for autoimmune disorders targets the B-cells that are causing an overreaction of the immune system, which translates to symptoms. It would clear away those B-cells and make room for new, young cells that aren't triggered to overreact.\n\nShe said the latest round of funding will help the company expand its operations a little bit and advance its lead therapy to the clinic. The company has 79 employees and operates out of Alexandria GradLabs in La Jolla.\n\nCapstan also has major institutional investors who participated in its latest fundraising round, including Forbion, Mubadala Capital, Perceptive Advisors, Sofinnova Investments, Alexandria Venture Investments, OrbiMed, Polaris Partners and Vida Ventures. Shawver said she's grateful that they have the support of investors from both big pharma and traditional firms who believe in Capstan's potential.\n\nWhile it's true San Diego has seen deals pick up in recent months, it's been harder for startups to fund-raise. Overall, venture capitalists are being more selective about investments compared to the heydaysof 2021 when money was flowing at record levels.\n\nShawver has been around to see the pendulum swing both ways in this industry. Prior to leading Capstan, Shawver was CEO of Silverback Therapeutics and also Synthorx, which was acquired by Sanofi.\n\nIn 2023, financing rounds for biotech companies exceeding $100 million were rare. But Shawver said things picked up following some big deals -- like the $4.1 billion acquisition of RayzeBio by Bristol Myers Squibb -- in the fourth quarter of last year when Capstan started fundraising for this latest round.\n\n\"These M&A exits freed up some capital for investors to reinvest in new companies,\" she said.\n\nMarket interest in local life science companies has picked up more recently.\n\nThis month, San Diego saw its first two life science IPO's in months -- Boundless Bio and Contineum Therapeutics -- to kick off 2024. On Tuesday, local biotech Engrail Therapeutics said it exceeded its financing goal by closing a $157 million Series B round.",

        "body": "FedEx Express, a unit of FedEx Corp, said on Wednesday that it had completed significant upgrades to its gateway facility in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, in a move that is expected to fortify its foothold in the ever-expanding Chinese market.\n\nThe company expanded its Shenzhen International Gateway at Baoan International Airport -- one of the four major FedEx international gateways in China -- to over 4,500 square meters, doubling the sorting capacity of packages and documents, while increasing freight handling capacity by 50 percent.\n\nAfter the upgrades, the facility boasts an intelligent management system dubbed e-warehouse, the company said.\n\n\"Shenzhen, renowned for its trailblazing economic innovations, has always been a focal point in our growth strategy,\" said Robert Chu, vice-president of operations at FedEx China.\n\n\"Our expanded gateway represents a milestone in our commitment to Shenzhen and the broader South China region. By fostering a more efficient Customs clearance process, we aim to empower businesses here with a seamless international trade experience, bolstering their global competitiveness,\" Chu said.\n\nAs a robust engine of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Shenzhen has been the top foreign trade city in China for the past 30 consecutive years due to its efficient logistics systems and innovative measures such as the \"Smooth Flow Plan\" for sea and air ports.\n\nShenzhen Customs posted 675.2 billion yuan ($93.8 billion) in imports and exports in the first two months of this year, a robust year-on-year growth of 45 percent.\n\nThe data further cemented the city's position as a leader in the nation's cross-border e-commerce sector, which achieved an import and export volume of 326.53 billion yuan in 2023, a year-on-year growth of 74.4 percent.\n\nIn the first two months, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations became Shenzhen's largest trading partner, with trade value totaling 106.92 billion yuan, a 58.1 percent increase.\n\nWang Mingyong, deputy general manager of Shenzhen Guanxu Electronics, a headphone manufacturer, said: \"Our company's export volume increased by 40 percent in the past two months, especially to the Philippines, where exports increased by eightfold compared to the same period last year.\"\n\nWang said that to further explore the ASEAN market, his company plans to establish an Amazon sales center in the Philippines in May and he is expecting a fivefold increase in overseas market exports this year.\n\nWang Zhen, vice-director of the Department of Regional Planning and Development at China Development Institute in Shenzhen, said that by leveraging their respective comparative advantages and thanks to Shenzhen's robust manufacturing industrial base, the scale of intermediate goods trade between Shenzhen and ASEAN continues to expand, while the momentum for open cooperation between Shenzhen and ASEAN is also growing stronger.",

        "body": "FedEx (NYSE: FDX) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q3 2024 results on Thursday, March 21. We expect it to post revenue in line and earnings above the street expectations. FedEx will likely see a marginal growth in its average daily volumes across its segments, and it should benefit from its cost reduction actions. Our interactive dashboard analysis of FedEx's Earnings Preview has additional details.\n\nLooking at FDX stock performance, it has seen little change, moving slightly from levels of $260 in early January 2021 to around $255 now. This compares with an increase of about 35% for the S&P 500 over this roughly three-year period. Overall, the performance of FDX stock with respect to the index has been lackluster. Returns for the stock were 0% in 2021, -33% in 2022, and 46% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that FDX underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Industrials sector including GE, CAT, and UNP, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT.\n\nIn contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nGiven the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could FDX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, FDX stock appears to have some room for growth.\n\n(1) Revenues expected to align with the consensus estimates\n\n(2) EPS likely to be above the consensus estimates\n\n(3) FDX stock has some room for growth\n\nWhile FDX stock looks like it has some room for growth, it is helpful to see how FedEx's Peers fare on metrics that matter.

        "body": "Three young boys, aged 11, 12, and 16, and dubbed Houston's \"Little Rascals,\" have been arrested by the FBI for allegedly robbing a Wells Fargo bank.\n\nAccording to FBI Houston officials, three juvenile boys were taken into custody and are now facing charges in connection with a bank robbery last week. The three boys first made headlines when authorities shared on social media that they were wanted.\n\nThe Houston FBI office said that on Thursday (March 14), the trio, comprised of an 11-year-old, a 12-year-old, and a 16-year-old, allegedly robbed a Wells Fargo bank in North Houston. The incident occurred just after 3 p.m. at the Wells Fargo on the North Freeway at West Road, which sits in the Greenspoint area.\n\nRELATED: Texas Man Uses BMW Dealership Loaner To Rob Bank So He Can Buy His Own\n\nFBI officials said that the three young men allegedly threatened a bank teller, and were believed to be armed. However, witnesses, who assumed the boys were between the ages of 14 and 18, said that they didn't see any weapons being drawn or any in their possession. The trio then fled the bank on foot with an undisclosed amount of money.\n\nAfter the three boys were accused of robbing the Wells Fargo bank, the FBI posted their photos to social media and asked for help in identifying and catching the suspects, deemed the \"Little Rascals.\" Speaking with ABC13, Mike Schneider, a retired juvenile district court judge, said, \"The age of the younger two, that's unusual for a bank robbery. It's one of the first times I've seen that.\"\n\nSchneider continued, \"I was thinking either this was very low in sophistication or maybe an adult had something to do with this. That is not uncommon. Because kids have a punishment that is less severe, it is not uncommon for adult offenders to get them to commit crimes.\"\n\nRELATED: 78-Year-Old Missouri Woman Accused Of Bank Robbery - For A Third Time\n\nIt's reported that both FBI Houston and the Harris County Sheriff's Office (HCSO) are working to solve the case. However, while FBI Houston released the surveillance photos, the Sheriff's Office is leading the investigation. Per HCSO, once FBI Houston released the photos, HCSO began receiving tips from the public.\n\nReportedly, two of the three boys' parents came forward and identified them. The third boy was later identified and taken into custody after being handled by another law enforcement agency following a fight. According to the Harris County Sheriff's Office, authorities ended up recovering a weapon and a distinctive item pictured in one of the surveillance photos released by FBI Houston.\n\nAuthorities have reported that the \"Little Rascals\" are being charged with robbery by threat, a second-degree felony.\n\nIt has not been disclosed whether any cash was recovered or if anyone else was involved in the incident. However, if the three boys are found guilty, they could face probation until they turn 18 or face juvenile prison until the age of 19, per a criminal defense attorney. The attorney claims that the 16-year-old could also be charged as an adult, but it is not likely.\n\nRELATED: Bank Of America Ordered To Pay More Than $100M To Customers For Double-Dipping On Fees, Opening Accounts Without Consent And More\n\n#Socialites, be sure to check out the post below, then leave us your thoughts in a comment after!",

        "body": "Three teenagers made national headlines after they robbed a north Houston bank, but their underage reign of terror came to an end after their parents turned them in to police.\n\nNo other details were released about the trio because of their ages.\n\nThe Harris County Sheriff's Office said that the boys passed a threatening note to a bank cashier at the Wells Fargo bank in Greenspoint just after 3 p.m. on Thursday. The boys did not present a weapon, but the cashier believed they were armed, and they were able to escape on foot with an undisclosed amount of money.\n\nInitially witnesses described the kids as aged between 14 and 18 years.\n\nAfter the FBI office in Houston released a surveillance photo of the children, tips started rolling in. Parents of two of the boys turned them in to police while a third was identified by law enforcement after he got into a fight. Investigators said they recovered a weapon and also an item that was distinctive from the photos taken during the robbery.\n\nThe children will be charged with second-degree felony robbery by threat. They face probation until 18 years of age or juvenile prison until 19 years of age, according to a criminal defense attorney who spoke to KTRK-TV.\n\nThey were dubbed the \"Little Rascals\" by the FBI in their initial request for information from the public.\n\nRetired juvenile district court judge Mike Schneider told KTRK that it was very unusual for bank robbery suspects to be so young.\n\n\"It's one of the first times I've seen that,\" he said. \"I was thinking either this was very low in sophistication or maybe an adult had something to do with this. That is not uncommon. Because kids have a punishment that is less severe, it is not uncommon for adult offenders to get them to commit crimes.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officials have not said whether other suspects were involved in the alleged bank heist.\n\nSome on social media used the occasion to mock the FBI when they initially asked for help identifying the kiddie culprits.\n\n\"I dont know which is more embarrassing that a bank got robbed by some middle schoolers or that the fbi cant find them,\" responded one X user.",

        "title": "Expecting windfall from wave of cancer patients, Pfizer leases huge property in San Diego for research and development of cancer drugs   - NaturalNews.com",
        "body": "This comes amid a noticeable increase in the number of people receiving cancer treatment in recent years, particularly after the global rollout of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines. (Related: Vaccine side effect? Swiss health insurer's data shows 73% increase in people receiving cancer treatment since 2020.)\n\nBloomberg News reported that Pfizer agreed to a 15-year lease for 230,000 square feet at the Torrey View life sciences complex in Silicon Beach, citing a statement by developer Breakthrough Properties. The drug manufacturer will occupy two research and development buildings at the 10-acre campus, which is nearing completion.\n\nAccording to the statement, the property offers \"high-quality lab infrastructure\" along with a 400-person conference facility, ocean views and campus amenities such as a fitness center and pickleball court.\n\n\"Torrey View is an ideal campus for innovation,\" Breakthrough Properties CEO Dan Belldegrun said in the March 15 statement. \"Breakthrough is proud to support the Pfizer Oncology team as they continue to discover and develop next-generation therapies.\"\n\nThe statement didn't disclose the financial terms of the lease. But based on data from CBRE Group Inc. on average asking rents in the area, the total for the 15-year deal would be about $290 million.\n\nAccording to CBRE, the Pfizer lease is more than double the size of any life-science deal in the San Diego area in 2023. That year, the largest single tenant was medical test kit maker Acon taking 97,162 square feet of real estate space.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

However, demand for offices slowed down in 2023 as venture capital funding decreased.\n\nPfizer's pivot away from Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) products and into cancer drugs comes at a crucial time. The New York-based drug firm has been trying to shore up investor sentiment after its shares fell more than 40 percent in 2023. This translated to an erasure of more than $100 billion in Pfizer's market value.\n\nAccording to CNBC, Pfizer is betting on cancer drugs to help it regain its footing after a rocky year marked by the rapid decline of its COVID-19 business. Its acquisition of cancer drug manufacturer Seagen for $43 billion proves that it is ready to move on from COVID-19. With the Seagen product line incorporated into Pfizer, the latter is ready to produce at least eight cancer drugs by 2030 and 60 different experimental drugs on the pipeline. (Related: NEVER FORGET: Pfizer RIGGED scientific studies, promoted off-label use of its epilepsy drug Neurontin to hit sales targets.)\n\nHowever, some analysts have noted that it might take a few years for some of Pfizer's cancer drugs in mid-stage development to show pivotal clinical trial data and become less risky. But it's not just drugs in the works; Pfizer's existing oncology portfolio is also facing some competitive pressure.\n\nRevenue from the blockbuster breast cancer drug Ibrance and prostate cancer treatment Xtandi, which Pfizer shares with Astellas Pharma, has declined over the past year. Both drugs are expected to lose market exclusivity in 2027.\n\nAside from this, Pfizer disappointed Wall Street last year with the underwhelming launch of a new RSV shot, a twice-daily weight loss pill that fell short in clinical trials and a 2024 forecast that missed expectations. The company has launched a $4 billion cost-cutting program, laying off hundreds of employees and shaving down its research and development spending.\n\nWatch this video about Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccines containing toxic and carcinogenic DNA.\n\nHealth Canada confirms that Pfizer COVID-19 injections contain SV40 DNA sequence that can cause CANCER.\n\nScientist says Pfizer INTENTIONALLY DECEIVED regulators about COVID-19 vaccine contamination.\n\nFRESHLY OVERLAID graphene oxide \"nanobots\" found in Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nRSV introduced into population by polio vaccines; now Pfizer's RSV vaccines risk harming, killing people.",

        "title": "MIL-OSI Economics: Pfizer's Braftovi to command 42% share of BRAF inhibitors melanoma market by...",
        "body": "Since Roche's Zelboraf gained (vemurafenib) FDA approval in 2011, significant strides have been made in BRAF-targeted cancer therapies, underscoring the significance of combating BRAF mutations in melanoma. Against this backdrop, Pfizer's Braftovi (encorafenib) is positioned to secure a dominant 42% share of the BRAF inhibitors market for melanoma by 2028, underscoring its pivotal role in cancer therapy. Braftovi's emergence underscores Pfizer's commitment to advancing oncological treatments to address critical medical needs, according to GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.\n\nGlobalData's patient-based forecast reveals that the BRAF inhibitor market for melanoma will reach a key milestone by 2028, with over $1 billion in sales in eight major markets (the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, and Australia). Pfizer's Braftovi will take the lead, boasting $424 million in sales, with Novartis' Tafinlar (dabrafenib) in second place with $364 million and 36% of the overall BTK inhibitor therapy market by 2028.\n\nBiswajit Podder, Oncology and Hematology Analyst at GlobalData, comments: \"Braftovi, in combination with Eli Lilly's Erbitux (cetuximab), is used for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring the BRAF V600E mutation. Braftovi's role is expected to grow in the future because of its October 2023 approval, together with Mektovi, for the treatment of metastatic BRAF-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) newly diagnosed patients or those who received prior therapy but not BRAF inhibitors.\"\n\nThe approval is based on a Phase II clinical study (PHAROS; NCT03915951), which found a 75% objective response rate in treatment-na\u00efve individuals and 46% in previously treated patients.\n\nBraftovi, in combination with Pfizer's Mektovi (binimetinib), outperforms its close competitor, Tafinlar, in combination with Novartis's Mekinist (trametinib), in efficacy, tolerability, and side effects. This regimen is approved for melanoma that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery. Combining MEK inhibitors with BRAF kinase inhibitors would delay mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-driven acquired resistance and increase response rate and duration.\n\nPodder concludes: \"After FDA approval of Braftovi, the European Medicines Agency received an MAA for the combination of Braftovi and Mektovi to treat treatment-na\u00efve NSCLC harboring BRAF V600E mutation. GlobalData reports 27 Phase I-III ongoing clinical trials investigating its effectiveness in solid and hematological cancers. If Braftovi gets approval for other indications, like relapsed multiple myeloma or metastatic brain tumor, or in combination with immunotherapy for melanoma, it will strengthen its market position.\"",

        "body": "A San Diego biotech is working on therapies that could tackle life-altering conditions, like autoimmune diseases and cancer, by modifying cells. But instead of engineering cells in a lab, they're doing it inside your body.\n\nThanks to that novel approach and the support of some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry, Capstan Therapeutics has netted $175 million in a fundraising round, despite a sluggish venture capital environment for startups. La Jolla-based Capstan, which made the announcement Wednesday, exceeded its fundraising goal of $125 million in a Series B round led by RA Capital Management.\n\nThe firm explained that it is employing the cutting-edge messenger-RNA technology that made the COVID-19 vaccine possible and marrying it with the science behind cell therapy.\n\n\"If it weren't for cell therapy, Capstan wouldn't exist. If it weren't for the COVID-19 vaccine, Capstan wouldn't exist. It's almost like the two had a baby and they created Capstan,\" said Laura Shawver, the company's president and CEO.\n\nShe said the company is working on a cheaper and less complex multi-step process for getting essential therapies to more patients.\n\nBeyond the major funding, Capstan boasts backing from more than a handful of big pharma companies such as Johnson & Johnson Innovation (JJDC), Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, Leaps by Bayer, Novartis Venture Fund and Pfizer Ventures.\n\nCapstan was founded in 2021 and has raised $340 million to date. The scientific research behind Capstan came out of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIts founders are pioneers of CAR-T cell technology, which has led to revolutionary therapies that modify immune system cells, or T-cells, in a lab to help a patient's body target and destroy disease causing cells, like cancer.\n\nCapstan is developing therapies that modulate unhealthy cells inside the body -- rather than editing the cells outside of the body -- through RNA delivery methods.\n\nShawver explained that while CAR-T cell therapies have proven effective, they are not widely accessible to most patients and they are costly. It requires the extraction of samples from patients, external manufacturing, and then the patients have to undergo chemotherapy to prepare their bodies for the integration of the cell therapy.\n\n\"It's just impractical to get it to most people,\" Shawver said. \"So as a result, a number of companies are trying in vivo (inside the body) approaches to deliver directly to T-cells that can then fight the diseases once they're engineered in the body.\n\n\"This is why our industry needs to have a different approach so that we can bring it forward to more people in an easier way.\"\n\nCapstan encodes mRNA, packages it in a lipid nanoparticle that is \"decorated\" with an antibody, which directs the body's T-cells to attack problematic cells.\n\nThere are broad applications for this platform technology, Shawver said, but right now Capstan is looking at ways to treat cancer, fibrosis, and autoimmune and genetic blood disorders.\n\nIn essence, its lead therapy for autoimmune disorders targets the B-cells that are causing an overreaction of the immune system, which translates to symptoms. It would clear away those B-cells and make room for new, young cells that aren't triggered to overreact.\n\nShe said the latest round of funding will help the company expand its operations a little bit and advance its lead therapy to the clinic. The company has 79 employees and operates out of Alexandria GradLabs in La Jolla.\n\nCapstan also has major institutional investors who participated in its latest fundraising round, including Forbion, Mubadala Capital, Perceptive Advisors, Sofinnova Investments, Alexandria Venture Investments, OrbiMed, Polaris Partners and Vida Ventures. Shawver said she's grateful that they have the support of investors from both big pharma and traditional firms who believe in Capstan's potential.\n\nWhile it's true San Diego has seen deals pick up in recent months, it's been harder for startups to fund-raise. Overall, venture capitalists are being more selective about investments compared to the heydaysof 2021 when money was flowing at record levels.\n\nShawver has been around to see the pendulum swing both ways in this industry. Prior to leading Capstan, Shawver was CEO of Silverback Therapeutics and also Synthorx, which was acquired by Sanofi.\n\nIn 2023, financing rounds for biotech companies exceeding $100 million were rare. But Shawver said things picked up following some big deals -- like the $4.1 billion acquisition of RayzeBio by Bristol Myers Squibb -- in the fourth quarter of last year when Capstan started fundraising for this latest round.\n\n\"These M&A exits freed up some capital for investors to reinvest in new companies,\" she said.\n\nMarket interest in local life science companies has picked up more recently.\n\nThis month, San Diego saw its first two life science IPO's in months -- Boundless Bio and Contineum Therapeutics -- to kick off 2024. On Tuesday, local biotech Engrail Therapeutics said it exceeded its financing goal by closing a $157 million Series B round.",

        "body": "(1) On the date of this pricing supplement, the estimated value of the securities is $975.80 per security, which is less than the issue price. The estimated value of the securities is based on CGMI's proprietary pricing models and our internal funding rate. It is not an indication of actual profit to CGMI or other of our affiliates, nor is it an indication of the price, if any, at which CGMI or any other person may be willing to buy the securities from you at any time after issuance. See \"Valuation of the Securities\" in this pricing supplement.\n\n(2) CGMI will receive an underwriting fee of up to $20.00 for each security sold in this offering. The total underwriting fee and proceeds to issuer in the table above give effect to the actual total underwriting fee. For more information on the distribution of the securities, see \"Supplemental Plan of Distribution\" in this pricing supplement. In addition to the underwriting fee, CGMI and its affiliates may profit from hedging activity related to this offering, even if the value of the securities declines. See \"Use of Proceeds and Hedging\" in the accompanying prospectus.\n\n(3) The per security proceeds to issuer indicated above represent the minimum per security proceeds to issuer for any security, assuming the maximum per security underwriting fee. As noted above, the underwriting fee is variable.\n\nInvesting in the securities involves risks not associated with an investment in conventional debt securities. See \"Summary Risk Factors\" beginning on page PS-5.\n\nNeither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the securities or determined that this pricing supplement and the accompanying product supplement, underlying supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus are truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.\n\nYou should read this pricing supplement together with the accompanying product supplement, underlying supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus, which can be accessed via the hyperlinks below:\n\nProduct Supplement No. EA-02-10 dated March 7, 2023 Underlying Supplement No. 11 dated March 7, 2023\n\nProspectus Supplement and Prospectus each dated March 7, 2023\n\nThe securities are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.\n\nThe terms of the securities are set forth in the accompanying product supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus, as supplemented by this pricing supplement. The accompanying product supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus contain important disclosures that are not repeated in this pricing supplement. For example, the accompanying product supplement contains important information about how the closing value of the underlying will be determined and about adjustments that may be made to the terms of the securities upon the occurrence of market disruption events and other specified events with respect to the underlying. The accompanying underlying supplement contains information about the underlying that is not repeated in this pricing supplement. It is important that you read the accompanying product supplement, underlying supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus together with this pricing supplement in connection with your investment in the securities. Certain terms used but not defined in this pricing supplement are defined in the accompanying product supplement.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates your payment at maturity for a range of hypothetical underlying returns.\n\nInvestors in the securities will not receive any dividends with respect to the underlying. The diagram and examples below do not show any effect of lost dividend yield over the term of the securities. See \"Summary Risk Factors -- You will not receive dividends or have any other rights with respect to the underlying\" below.\n\nThe examples below illustrate how to determine the payment at maturity on the securities, assuming the various hypothetical final underlying values indicated below. The examples are solely for illustrative purposes, do not show all possible outcomes and are not a prediction of what the actual payment at maturity on the securities will be. The actual payment at maturity will depend on the actual final underlying value.\n\nThe examples below are based on a hypothetical initial underlying value of 100.00 and do not reflect the actual initial underlying value. For the actual initial underlying value, see the cover page of this pricing supplement. We have used this hypothetical value, rather than the actual value, to simplify the calculations and aid understanding of how the securities work. However, you should understand that the actual payment at maturity on the securities will be calculated based on the actual initial underlying value, and not this hypothetical value. For ease of analysis, figures below have been rounded.\n\nExample 1 -- Upside Scenario A. The final underlying value is 95.00, resulting in a -5.00% underlying return. In this example, the final underlying value is less than the initial underlying value.\n\nPayment at maturity per security = $1,000 + the digital return amount\n\nIn this scenario, because the final underlying value is less than the initial underlying value, your total return at maturity would equal the digital return amount.\n\nExample 2 -- Upside Scenario B. The final underlying value is 65.00, resulting in a -35.00% underlying return. In this example, the final underlying value is less than the initial underlying value.\n\nPayment at maturity per security = $1,000 + the digital return amount\n\nIn this scenario, because the final underlying value is less than the initial underlying value, your total return at maturity would equal the digital return amount. In this scenario, the digital return is less than absolute value of the underlying return, and as a result, an investment in the securities would underperform a hypothetical alternative investment providing 1-to-1 inverse exposure to the depreciation of the underlying.\n\nExample 3 -- Downside Scenario A. The final underlying value is 170.00, resulting in a 70.00% underlying return. In this example, the final underlying value is greater than the initial underlying value.\n\nPayment at maturity per security = $1,000 - ($1,000 \u00d7 the underlying return), subject to the maximum loss at maturity\n\nIn this scenario, the underlying has appreciated from the initial underlying value to the final underlying value. As a result, your total return at maturity in this scenario would be negative and would reflect 1-to-1 inverse exposure to the positive performance of the underlying, subject to the maximum loss at maturity.\n\nExample 4 -- Downside Scenario B. The final underlying value is 220.00, resulting in a 120.00% underlying return. In this example, the final underlying value is greater than the initial underlying value.\n\nPayment at maturity per security = $1,000 - ($1,000 \u00d7 the underlying return), subject to the maximum loss at maturity\n\nIn this scenario, the underlying has appreciated from the initial underlying value to the final underlying value. As a result, your total return at maturity would reflect 1-to-1 inverse exposure to the positive performance of the underlying, and you would incur a loss at maturity equal to the maximum loss at maturity.\n\nAn investment in the securities is significantly riskier than an investment in conventional debt securities. The securities are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in our conventional debt securities (guaranteed by Citigroup Inc.), including the risk that we and Citigroup Inc. may default on our obligations under the securities, and are also subject to risks associated with the underlying. Accordingly, the securities are suitable only for investors who are capable of understanding the complexities and risks of the securities. You should consult your own financial, tax and legal advisors as to the risks of an investment in the securities and the suitability of the securities in light of your particular circumstances.\n\nThe following is a summary of certain key risk factors for investors in the securities. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of risks relating to an investment in the securities contained in the section \"Risk Factors Relating to the Securities\" beginning on page EA-7 in the accompanying product supplement. You should also carefully read the risk factors included in the accompanying prospectus supplement and in the documents incorporated by reference in the accompanying prospectus, including Citigroup Inc.'s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which describe risks relating to the business of Citigroup Inc. more generally.\n\nyield on the underlying and interest rates. CGMI's views on these inputs may differ from your or others' views, and as an underwriter in this offering, CGMI's interests may conflict with yours. Both the models and the inputs to the models may prove to be wrong and therefore not an accurate reflection of the value of the securities. Moreover, the estimated value of the securities set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement may differ from the value that we or our affiliates may determine for the securities for other purposes, including for accounting purposes. You should not invest in the securities because of the estimated value of the securities. Instead, you should be willing to hold the securities to maturity irrespective of the initial estimated value.\n\nBecause there is not an active market for traded instruments referencing our outstanding debt obligations, CGMI determines our secondary market rate based on the market price of traded instruments referencing the debt obligations of Citigroup Inc., our parent company and the guarantor of all payments due on the securities, but subject to adjustments that CGMI makes in its sole discretion. As a result, our secondary market rate is not a market-determined measure of our creditworthiness, but rather reflects the market's perception of our parent company's creditworthiness as adjusted for discretionary factors such as CGMI's preferences with respect to purchasing the securities prior to maturity.\n\nas calculation agent, will be required to make discretionary judgments that could significantly affect your return on the securities. In making these judgments, the calculation agent's interests as an affiliate of ours could be adverse to your interests as a holder of the securities. See \"Risk Factors Relating to the Securities -- Risk Factors Relating to All Securities -- The calculation agent, which is an affiliate of ours, will make important determinations with respect to the securities\" in the accompanying product supplement.\n\nIf you are a non-U.S. investor, you should review the discussion of withholding tax issues in \"United States Federal Tax Considerations -- Non-U.S. Holders\" below.\n\nYou should read carefully the discussion under \"United States Federal Tax Considerations\" and \"Risk Factors Relating to the Securities\" in the accompanying product supplement and \"United States Federal Tax Considerations\" in this pricing supplement. You should also consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the securities, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index consists of the common stocks of 500 issuers selected to provide a performance benchmark for the large capitalization segment of the U.S. equity markets. It is calculated and maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC.\n\nPlease refer to the section \"Equity Index Descriptions -- The S&P U.S. Indices\" in the accompanying underlying supplement for additional information.\n\nWe have derived all information regarding the S&P 500 Index from publicly available information and have not independently verified any information regarding the S&P 500 Index. This pricing supplement relates only to the securities and not to the S&P 500 Index. We make no representation as to the performance of the S&P 500 Index over the term of the securities.\n\nThe securities represent obligations of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (guaranteed by Citigroup Inc.) only. The sponsor of the S&P 500 Index is not involved in any way in this offering and has no obligation relating to the securities or to holders of the securities.\n\nThe graph below shows the closing value of the S&P 500 Index for each day such value was available from January 2, 2014 to March 18, 2024. We obtained the closing values from Bloomberg L.P., without independent verification. You should not take historical closing values as an indication of future performance.\n\nYou should read carefully the discussion under \"United States Federal Tax Considerations\" and \"Risk Factors Relating to the Securities\" in the accompanying product supplement and \"Summary Risk Factors\" in this pricing supplement.\n\nIn the opinion of our counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, which is based on current market conditions, a security should be treated as a prepaid financial contract that is an \"open transaction\" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. By purchasing a security, you agree (in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary) to this treatment. There is uncertainty regarding this treatment, and the IRS or a court might not agree with it.\n\nAssuming this treatment of the securities is respected and subject to the discussion in \"United States Federal Tax Considerations\" in the accompanying product supplement, the following U.S. federal income tax consequences should result under current law:\n\nPlease see the discussion under \"United States Federal Tax Considerations -- Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders -- Securities Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts\" in the accompanying product supplement for further discussion about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the securities.\n\nWe do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the treatment of the securities. An alternative characterization of the securities could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of ownership and disposition of the securities, including the timing and character of income recognized. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have requested comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of \"prepaid forward contracts\" and similar financial instruments and have indicated that such transactions may be the subject of future regulations or other guidance. Furthermore, members of Congress have proposed legislative changes to the tax treatment of derivative contracts. Any legislation, Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax adviser regarding possible alternative tax treatments of the securities and potential changes in applicable law.\n\nNon-U.S. Holders. Subject to the discussions below and in \"United States Federal Tax Considerations\" in the accompanying product supplement, if you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the accompanying product supplement) of the securities, you generally should not be subject to U.S. federal withholding or income tax in respect of any amount paid to you with respect to the securities, provided that (i) income in respect of the securities is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and (ii) you comply with the applicable certification requirements.\n\nAs discussed under \"United States Federal Tax Considerations -- Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders\" in the accompanying product supplement, Section 871(m) of the Code and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (\"Section 871(m)\") generally impose a 30% withholding tax on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to Non-U.S. Holders with respect to certain financial instruments linked to U.S. equities (\"U.S. Underlying Equities\") or indices that include U.S. Underlying Equities. Section 871(m) generally applies to instruments that substantially replicate the economic performance of one or more U.S. Underlying Equities, as determined based on tests set forth in the applicable Treasury regulations. In light of the fact that the payout on the securities is inversely related to the performance of the underlying, payment on the securities to Non-U.S. Holders will not be subject to Section 871(m).\n\nA determination that the securities are not subject to Section 871(m) is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this treatment. Moreover, Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including your other transactions. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the securities.\n\nIf withholding tax applies to the securities, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.\n\nYou should read the section entitled \"United States Federal Tax Considerations\" in the accompanying product supplement. The preceding discussion, when read in combination with that section, constitutes the full opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP regarding the material U.S. federal tax consequences of owning and disposing of the securities.\n\nYou should also consult your tax adviser regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences of an investment in the securities and any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.\n\nCGMI, an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and the underwriter of the sale of the securities, is acting as principal and will receive an underwriting fee of up to $20.00 for each security sold in this offering. The actual underwriting fee will be equal to the selling concession provided to selected dealers, as described in this paragraph. From this underwriting fee, CGMI will pay selected dealers not affiliated with CGMI a variable selling concession of up to $20.00 for each security they sell.\n\nSee \"Plan of Distribution; Conflicts of Interest\" in the accompanying product supplement and \"Plan of Distribution\" in each of the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus for additional information.\n\nCGMI calculated the estimated value of the securities set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement based on proprietary pricing models. CGMI's proprietary pricing models generated an estimated value for the securities by estimating the value of a hypothetical package of financial instruments that would replicate the payout on the securities, which consists of a fixed-income bond (the \"bond component\") and one or more derivative instruments underlying the economic terms of the securities (the \"derivative component\"). CGMI calculated the estimated value of the bond component using a discount rate based on our internal funding rate. CGMI calculated the estimated value of the derivative component based on a proprietary derivative-pricing model, which generated a theoretical price for the instruments that constitute the derivative component based on various inputs, including the factors described under \"Summary Risk Factors -- The value of the securities prior to maturity will fluctuate based on many unpredictable factors\" in this pricing supplement, but not including our or Citigroup Inc.'s creditworthiness. These inputs may be market-observable or may be based on assumptions made by CGMI in its discretionary judgment.\n\nFor a period of approximately two months following issuance of the securities, the price, if any, at which CGMI would be willing to buy the securities from investors, and the value that will be indicated for the securities on any brokerage account statements prepared by CGMI or its affiliates (which value CGMI may also publish through one or more financial information vendors), will reflect a temporary upward adjustment from the price or value that would otherwise be determined. This temporary upward adjustment represents a portion of the hedging profit expected to be realized by CGMI or its affiliates over the term of the securities. The amount of this temporary upward adjustment will decline to zero on a straight-line basis over the two-month temporary adjustment period. However, CGMI is not obligated to buy the securities from investors at any time. See \"Summary Risk Factors -- The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange and you may not be able to sell them prior to maturity.\"\n\nIn the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, as special products counsel to Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., when the securities offered by this pricing supplement have been executed and issued by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and authenticated by the trustee pursuant to the indenture, and delivered against payment therefor, such securities and the related guarantee of Citigroup Inc. will be valid and binding obligations of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and Citigroup Inc., respectively, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith), provided that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above.

        "title": "How PepsiCo Revamped Its Supply Chain",
        "body": "An inside look at how PepsiCo brought its big, bold vision to life\n\nPepsi, Doritos, Lay's, Tostitos ... even Captain Crunch. They are the food and beverages of our youths, and likely of our adulthood too, but they just don't magically appear on store shelves. They arrive there thanks to the extensive supply chain network parent company PepsiCo North America has built over decades.\n\nBut that supply chain needed an update a few years ago. And an update it received.\n\n\"It is a large and complex supply chain, and what I'm going to do this morning is share our story, our story of transformation that started three years ago when we announced a big, bold vision and all the things that we needed to do to adjust and start to embrace the complexity that that transformation afforded,\" Laura Maxwell told the audience at the recent Manifest conference in Las Vegas. Maxwell, who is the senior vice president of supply chain for PepsiCo North America, went on to tell her audience that it's \"important to take a step back and understand where you've come from.\"\n\nPerformance with purpose\n\nMaxwell detailed the transformation of PepsiCo's supply chain as it introduced the concept of \"performance with purpose.\"\n\n\"We have a tremendous CEO, Steven Williams -- he a visionary -- and he set up this vision for us coming out of COVID that said we needed to be always everywhere,\" Maxwell related. \"Now always is about the consumer. So always says that we should always be the consumer's choice in foods. Well, if you're always going to be the consumer's choice in foods, you can hardly just be chips in a bag. Although chips in a bag are great, we had to be about canisters and meat snacks and pasta and mixes and syrups and cookies. So, the complexity of going from a foods organization that was very much focused on a small number of substrates to a complex group of line items was definitely something that we had to embrace.\"\n\nPlaying catchup\n\nMaxwell said looking back, she realized PepsiCo was behind in manufacturing and distribution capacity.\n\n\"We didn't have the space or the number of SKUs that we needed in any of our fulfillment centers,\" she said. \"We had done fine on our sustainability journey. That's what I'd call it; we were doing fine on the journey of sustainability, but there was a lot that we needed to change and transform in a very quick way.\"\n\nThe supply chain was good at meeting line-item optimization, simplification of ingredients and location reduction, but to Maxwell, \"those were not things that were going to help us transform into an always everywhere world. So we knew we had to change.\"\n\nGiving credit to the vast team that made the transformation possible, Maxwell noted three areas that needed attention: technology partners, innovation partners, and digital partners. PepsiCo Labs led that journey, she said, with a vision to be \"a leader in tech innovation by integrating emerging tech solutions into PepsiCo.\"\n\nConnecting with innovators\n\nPepsiCo Labs has empowered the \"big ship\" that is hard to move to connect with innovators.\n\n\"They literally connect us. And what I think they do is it's about the potential of both businesses, both our business and the partners that we go with,\" Maxwell said. \"And there are two distinct things that they have done that I think set them apart from anyone else that does something like this. Number one, they know the business. If they were up here on stage with me, they know the supply chain as well as any of us know the supply chain. So, they don't just find solutions trying to chase down a problem that it would be good for. They understand the problems of the business and then go seek out emerging technology innovation, digital solutions that can help us solve them. Secondly, they have a very unique way of getting through this rapidly so that we can pilot and scale, whether it's manufacturing, warehousing, fleet, all the way through sales because they partner with all kinds [and] all sides of the business.\"\n\nMaxwell said PepsiCo Labs has evaluated over 2,500 startups and ultimately settled on approximately 200 pilot projects. Some of those have scaled, like autonomous technologies. The other area where PepsiCo Labs has led the transformation is in goal setting.\n\n\"Now that sounds obvious, we all set goals, but I don't know about you from a supply chain perspective, as an engineer, I was raised to only do smart goals. They have to be smart, they have to be achievable ... but here's what I've learned: When you have to transform, you need to set enormous goals, goals that scare people and then figure out how to go after them,\" Maxwell said.\n\nMeasure once, twice ...\n\nA couple of those goals were to measure everything -- water usage, carbon output -- and to create a path to decarbonization. PepsiCo is expecting to have all vehicles going in and out of a Queens, New York, distribution center to be electric before the end of this year. In Modesto, California, PepsiCo is running Tesla electric semi-trucks.\n\n\"We have been very focused,\" Maxwell said. \"By the end of last year, all the direct fleet coming in and out of Modesto achieved a 91% reduction in greenhouse gas thanks to those teams. So declaring enormous goals and going after them was definitely a part of the dream.\"\n\nThe final factor in the transformation, which Maxwell touched on earlier, is the partnership aspect.\n\n\"When we came out of COVID and we said, okay, we've got to transform, what I said to myself as a leader is, truthfully, I will be happy just to get back to pre-COVID levels,\" Maxwell said. \"That's where I'll be happy. And again, I get to stand on the stage, but thanks to the amazing teams in supply chain, those goals have been far exceeded in the last three years. And so much of that is because we didn't choose to go out on this journey alone. We chose partners.\"",

The beverage giant has served Subway's US restaurants for nearly 20 years, the company said.\n\nSubway is Coca-Cola's largest US fountain account by number of locations, according to Beverage Digest.\n\nSubway, which operates about 20,000 restaurants in the US and nearly 37,000 worldwide, said it's also extending its existing agreement with Frito-Lay, PepsiCo's snack-food unit, to provide chips and snacks at its restaurants through 2030. PepsiCo already provides beverages at Subway shops in several regions outside the US.\n\nSubway announced a deal in 2023 to be acquired by the Atlanta-based private equity firm Roark Capital Group for nearly $10 billion. The deal is pending a Federal Trade Commission investigation, according to Politico.\n\nPepsiCo shares rose 0.7 percentat 10:02 a.m. in New York. Coca-Cola stock was up 0.2 percent.",

        "body": "These funds aim to help Intel, which lost its manufacturing edge to TSMC, repair its business model.\n\nPresident Joe Biden awarded Intel nearly $20 billion in grants and loans to boost domestic semiconductor production, marking the largest U.S. government investment in chip manufacturing. In response to this Intel is planning to spend $100 billion across four U.S. states to build and expand factories and hopes to secure an additional $25 billion in tax breaks.\n\nThe focus of Intel's five-year spending plan is to transform empty fields near Columbus, Ohio, into the world's largest AI chip manufacturing site, starting as early as 2027. It includes revamping sites in New Mexico and Oregon and expanding operations in Arizona, where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is also constructing a massive factory.\n\nThe funding Intel received, part of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, aims to increase the U.S. share of advanced chip production from 0% to 20% by 2030. The initiative seeks to reduce reliance on China and Taiwan for semiconductors, with the U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity having fallen from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2020.\n\nThese funds will help Intel repair its business model. For years, Intel led the world in making the fastest and smallest semiconductors but lost its manufacturing edge to TSMC in the 2010s, leading to plummeting profit margins.\n\nCEO Pat Gelsinger announced a plan in 2021 to return Intel to the top position, stating that government support is needed to make the plan profitable. With that assistance, Intel plans to spend about 30% of the $100-billion plan on construction costs, with the rest going towards purchasing chipmaking tools from various firms.",

        "title": "Chennai firm to produce battery-powered toothbrushes for Procter & Gamble",
        "body": "Oral-B is a popular toothbrush brand, but few know that any Oral-B toothbrush picked up in any shop anywhere in the world outside China, is produced in a little factory on the outskirts of Chennai.\n\nRialto Enterprises, part of the Rayala Group, produces 2 million Oral-B toothbrushes in 400 variants each day for P&G. These are shipped to 140 countries.\n\nAnd now, the company is gearing up to produce battery-powered toothbrushes. Work on the new facility is set to begin shortly. \"Big expansion plans are underway,\" says Chander Swamy, CEO of Rialto. The $3-million new plant will go on stream early 2025.\n\nA visit to the plant shows that making simple, ubiquitous toothbrushes is really a complicated job. The nylon bristles which arrive from DuPont are tightly bound within tubes that look like a rope as thick as a man's wrist but are actually an aggregation of thousands of nylon strands. A machine chops the 'rope', like cutting a snake's head, into little, 3-inch blocks. Another machine inserts them into the holes of polypropylene handles and another one staples them at high speed, to make the full brush. It requires training to operate the machines. The plant employs about a thousand trained operators, about 60 per cent of whom are women.\n\nAs the brushes come in several hundred different varieties, it involves many complex functions.\n\n\"It requires the manufacturing teams to be aligned to a fluctuating weekly global demand for the finished product, as well as to the supply of raw material from local vendors to ruthless delivery schedules,\" says Arunkumar Jayaraman, President-Operations.\n\nAlso read: Kumar Venkatasubramanian appointed new CEO of P&G India\n\nThe exacting cost structure doesn't make things easy, but Rialto Enterprises seems to have pulled it off, because it has just been selected by P&G for the Business Partner of Excellence Award, for the 9th time.\n\n\"P&G has about 70,000 business associates across the globe,\" notes Swamy.\n\nRialto Enterprises is a part of the Rayala G led by Ranjit Pratap. Rayala was once a major producer of the famous 'Halda' and later, 'Facit' brands of typewriters.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the company was exploring options for expansion and to add to its manufacturing depth. At that time the German multinational Braun was looking for a partner in the growing Indian market to handle the production of its range of appliances. After due diligence and assessment, Braun found a good fit in Rayala.\n\nRialto Enterprises was established to address this objective. Later, Braun was bought by The Gillette Company worldwide. A small but modern and efficient facility was built to manufacture Braun brand kitchen machines, blenders and men's shavers. These appliances were technologically superior and, given the close collaboration with the German partners and the US Gillette corporation.\n\n\"They helped Rialto cut its teeth in consumer product manufacture,\" says Swamy.\n\nIn 2005, Gillette was merged with P&G. In India, Rialto migrated to oral care with the manufacture of Braun Oral-B manual toothbrushes. Today, it is P&G's only contract-manufacturer of toothbrushes, outside China.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on March 20, 2024",

        "title": "1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks General Electric Stock Is Going to $191. Is It a buy?",
        "body": "In a matter of days, General Electric (NYSE: GE) will cease to exist.\n\nTo be more precise, GE will cease to exist in its current form. On April 2 the company -- which has already spun off its healthcare operations -- will split into two separate businesses. That means the latest analyst takes on GE will be the last in its current configuration.\n\nOne of those soon-to-be-outdated takes is quite bullish, anticipating a double-digit percentage rise in the share price. Let's see whether the company's future is as rosy as that prognosticator believes.\n\nGeneral Electric just got a big price target raise\n\nNear the beginning of March, UBS analyst Chris Snyder pumped his GE price target nearly 40% higher, changing it from $138 per share to $191. In doing so, he maintained his buy recommendation on the once-monolithic industrial stock. The new target implies a 10% bump over the next 12 months from the current price.\n\nIn his research note detailing the change, Snyder acknowledged that many market players consider GE to be richly valued. However, he wrote of \"the company's increasingly attractive positioning across favorable end markets.\" The analyst also feels that management is determined and able to grow all of its major business lines.\n\nHe added that \"when combined with impressive execution and a $60 billion-plus revenue base, GE continues to offer the most torque [toward developing a] positive rate of change across U.S. industrials.\"\n\nGE looks over-bought\n\nInvestors are excited about the continued division of GE, with the latest phase being the split into two (resulting in GE Vernova, the current company's power business and related assets, and the self-explanatory GE Aerospace). After all, those folks have pushed the stock's price up by 92% over the past year.\n\nI don't feel GE's current valuations are worth that kind of excitement, and it isn't probable that the three legacy companies will do vastly better on their own. Snyder is right about the present GE's advantages, but I don't feel they're electrifying enough to keep that share price soaring.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in General Electric right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in General Electric, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and General Electric wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nEric Volkman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "title": "Old tech firm IBM besting hot stocks amid its advances",
        "body": "One of the oldest companies in tech has been trouncing some of the hottest stocks on Wall Street.\n\nShares of International Business Machines Corp. are about 6% below an all-time high as investors expect a turnaround is finally bearing fruit after years of tepid growth and share-price returns. Compared to the Magnificent Seven, IBM's roughly 19% gain this year, including dividends, trails only Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\n\"IBM has been discounted by the rest of the industry, but it has made a lot of investments in both cloud and AI, and with a strong AI business, we could see growth inflecting higher,\" said Jethro Townsend, portfolio manager at Nia Impact Capital. He cites the firm's cash flow generation and \"healthy\" dividend yield as factors that provide room for it to re-rate higher.\n\nMuch of the year's advance followed IBM's results in late January, when it gave a better-than-expected forecast for both free cash flow and revenue and said it was seeing growing demand for its artificial intelligence products. The company has also cut jobs and expects to pause hiring for roles that could be replaced with artificial intelligence technology, which is seen as a potential tailwind for margins.\n\nThe surge is a recent phenomenon, however; while Apple Inc. has lagged this year, its five-year total return of 275% is much stronger than IBM's 82% gain over the same period.\n\nWall Street remains divided, with bulls outnumbered by skeptics and bears, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While it looks cheaper relative to most big-tech stocks, IBM's multiple of 19 times estimated earnings is near its highest in 20 years. The stock is 4% over the average price target, among the worst return potentials among components of the S&P 500 tech index.\n\nStill, the company offers something that is something of a rarity among big tech: a robust dividend. The indicated yield is 3.43%, well above others in the sector. The indicated yields for Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are below 1%, and while Nvidia pays a dividend, the yield is essentially non-existent.\n\n\"The CEO has done a heroic job in starting to turn the company around, but it is just generally slower growth, and not cheap enough to be enticing,\" said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors.\n\nIBM shares rose 63 cents, or 0.33%, to close Wednesday at $193.97.",

        "title": "\"MetLife Stadium will end his career\": NFL fans react to Mike Williams signing with Aaron Rodgers' Jets in free agency",
        "body": "Mike Williams is among the most sought-after free agents during the 2024 offseason following his release from the Los Angeles Chargers. During the 2022 NFL season, his big-game capability earned him 895 receiving yards and four touchdowns.\n\nSeveral teams might have contacted his camp, hoping to acquire the former Clemson standout. But the waiting game for his next squad has ended after he signed a one-year contract with the New York Jets worth up to $15 million.\n\nNFL Network National Insider Ian Rapoport reported that Williams will visit the Jets. But while Jets fans celebrate this signing, other football enthusiasts criticize the transaction. An NFL fan tweeted:\n\n\"Metlife Stadium will end Mike's career\"\n\nThe Jets' and the Giants' home field is widely regarded among NFL circles as the worst surface to play on. Their turf might have contributed to Aaron Rodgers' season-ending Achilles injury.\n\nLikewise, Nick Bosa, Solomon Thomas, Sterling Shepard, Wan'Dale Robinson, and Jabrill Peppers are some players who suffered ACL tears since the home teams installed a new turf surface at MetLife in 2020.\n\nJets fans don't want a repeat of Williams' 2023 season, wherein he suffered a season-ending ACL tear in their Week 3 game against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nHere are other comments regarding Mike Williams joining the Jets.\n\nAs the last commenter revealed, the New York Jets haven't had much success with free-agent wide receivers lately. After trading for Rodgers one day before the 2023 NFL Draft started, they signed Allen Lazard to a four-year, $44 million deal. Lazard had 311 yards and a touchdown in 14 games last season.\n\nMeanwhile, Randall Cobb had five receptions for 39 yards and a touchdown in 11 games last season. Mecole Hardman Jr. lasted only five games for the Jets before getting traded back to the Kansas City Chiefs. He caught the game-winning touchdown pass in overtime at Super Bowl 58.\n\nThe ups and downs of Mike Williams' NFL career\n\nAfter the Chargers selected Mike Williams seventh overall in 2017, he had 11 receptions for 95 yards in his rookie season.

        "body": "The cast of MTV 'Jersey Shore Family Vacation' were interviewed by Jenny McCarthy for her XM show 'Inner Circle,' discussing the newest season of the reality show.\n\nCast members of \"Jersey Shore Family Vacation\" went to the New York Jets Sept. 24 game against the New England Patriots at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford on the Thursday, March 14, episode of the show.\n\nThe roomies were invited by Aaron Rodgers, Jets quarterback and potential running mate with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for President of the United States.\n\nRodgers, who did not play in the game because of injury, did not appear on the episode -- but Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino detailed their relationship.\n\n\"When he got hurt last week (on Sept. 11) I sent him a DM saying the comeback is greater than the setback,\" said Mike to the roomies. \"Just saying something quick.\"\n\nRodgers revealed that he's a fan of the show during a May 23, 2023, press conference at the team's Florham Park training facility after he was traded to the Jets by the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\"Everybody wants to know what goes down in DMs between the Situation and Aaron Rodgers,\" Mike said. \"The answer is mutual admiration.\"\n\nRodgers later direct-messaged Mike to invite the cast to the game.\n\nSammi \"Sweetheat\" Giancola, who played soccer at William Paterson University, is especially thrilled.\n\n\"Literally my whole life I've been a Jets fan,\" Sammi says.\n\nNicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi, Jenni \"JWoww\" Farley and Deena Cortese rode up to MetLife and tailgated. Angelina Pivarnick, who was beefing with Sammi, came up later.\n\nMore: NY Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers is a 'Jersey Shore' fan: 'It's phenomenal'\n\nMore: After filming in Atlantic City, 'Jersey Shore' cast goes to Jets game at MetLife\n\nMike signed autographs in the parking lot and Jenni threw a ball to Jets player Bryce Hall. The roomies also said hello to comedian Jim Gaffigan. Nicole and Sammi were interviewed by newyorkjets.com, which wasn't shown on Thursday's episode.\n\nFollowing the game, Alexis Bawden, wife of Jets running back Nick Bawden, accused Angelina of \"sliding into\" her husband's direct messages.\n\n\"I just want to say, if you're a fan of her, she's weird,\" said Alexis Bawden on TikTok, referring to Angelina as Angela. \"That's weird. You don't message a married woman's man.\"\n\nAngelina replied on her Instagram Story.\n\n\"His wife is clearly a clout chaser and I only spoke to players I knew and in a friendly way, not a married man,\" Angelina said.\n\nThe incident was referred to with about 30 seconds of air time on Thursday.\n\n\"Are you flirting? Stop flirting,\" said Jenni to Angelina, who was on her phone in the stadium.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Kennedy Jr. confirmed that Rodgers is among his potential vice-presidential candidates. He'll make his announcement on Tuesday, March 26, Kennedy said. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are high-profile anti-vaccination advocates.\n\nThe cast of \"Jersey Shore Family Vacation\" does not discuss politics, or conspiracy theories, at length on the show. Mike, however, did bring the roomies to a Flat Earthers meeting in Florida last season.\n\nEarlier in the show, Sammi and Angelina continued their fight in Seaside Heights.\n\n\"I bring you back thinking you would be a friend to me and you literally have not been a friend,\" said Angelina to Sammi.\n\n\"You're actually jealous that I'm back,\" said Sammi, who returned last season. \"She thinks I owe her a lot for bringing me back.\"\n\nAngelina's hysterics grew to the point where she was doing jumping jacks at Nicole's summer home in Toms River while arguing with Sammi.\n\nLauren Sorrentino, wife of Mike, is trying to get a hold of her husband to tell him they're expecting baby No. 3. Apparently, it's easier for Aaron Rodgers to get a hold of Mike than his wife.\n\nShe calls Pauly DelVecchio in Las Vegas and Danny Merk at the Shore Store on the Seaside Heights boardwalk and tells them she's pregnant and unable to reach Mike.\n\n\"It's crazy that I know about this baby before Mike does,\" Pauly says.\n\nShe and baby Romeo eventually surprise Mike and the roomies at the Shore House in Seaside Heights, where they've decamped for the weekend. Tears of joy were shared.\n\nNext week, it's a trip to Nashville. Wayward castmate Ronnie Ortiz-Magro, Sammi's ex, might come along.\n\n\"We really have to think about Sam -- we have to be so sensitive to her feelings,\" Nicole said. \"I don't want her to leave again because we just got her back.\"\n\n\"Jersey Shore Family Vacation\" airs 8 p.m. Thursdays on MTV.\n\nSubscribe to app.com for the latest on the New Jersey reality TV scene.",

        "body": "The feds are aggressively trying to halt business mergers that regulators say are harmful to us.\n\nBack in 1883, a man named Bernard Kroger invested his life savings of $372 to open his first grocery store in Cincinnati.\n\nToday, Kroger has about 430,000 employees and 3,000 stores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, a college student named Joe Albertson worked his way up from grocery clerk at Safeway to manager of a dozen stores. In 1939, he opened his first store in Boise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday Albertsons has 285,000 employees and 2,200 stores.\n\nWatchdog Alert\n\nAre you a taxpayer in Texas? The Watchdog has your back.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIf Bernard and Joe could join up today, their Kroger/Albertsons would jointly have 5,000 stores and more than 700,000 employees, according to company filings.\n\nAnd that's exactly what the heirs to the founders are hoping for. Albertsons and Kroger want to merge but the Federal Trade Commission says, \"Not so fast.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn legal papers to stop the deal, the FTC says the merger would hurt consumers and raise prices. Kroger/Albertsons says the opposite will happen: because of the large-scale purchasing power, prices will go down.\n\nWho to believe?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor comparison sakes, the success of Walmart, cited as a need for the merger, has 2 million employees and 4,600 stores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it's not just the grocery business suffering from zealous federal regulators. In recent months the heavy hand of the FTC has come down hard on companies that subscribe to the popular merge-or-die syndrome of American business.\n\nThe Albertsons /Kroger proposal caught The Watchdog's eye because that's close to home for most of us North Texans.\n\nI dug around and found the number of blocked mergers quite remarkable. The Biden administration, acting through the U.S. Justice Department and the FTC, has embarked on the most aggressive promotion of competition in decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat follows the lead of President Joe Biden, who signed an executive order in 2021 that called for \"more robust scrutiny\" of bank-related deals.\n\nHalted mergers\n\nJetBlue Airways called off a $3.8 billion merger with Spirit Airlines. A Spirit executive cited \"regulatory uncertainty.\" JetBlue must pay Spirit a \"breakup fee\" of $69 million. This deal was halted after pressure from the Justice Department and a federal judge who said it would hinder fair competition.\n\nExxonMobil announced it wants to buy Irving-based Pioneer Natural Resources for $59.5 billion. In a statement, Pioneer said the companies \"continue to work constructively with the Federal Trade Commission in its review of the merger.\" Democratic U.S. senators are applying pressure, saying the sale is harmful to consumers and anti-competitive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCapitol One announced its intention to buy Discover Financial Services in a $35.3 billion deal. Federal regulators haven't announced their intention to block it, but President Biden has made it clear that he wants to thwart anti-competitive practices, especially in the financial world.\n\nChoice Hotels dropped its takeover of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. The FTC called it a win for consumers because it promotes competition.\n\nGood for consumers?\n\nI talked to economics teachers at both Southern Methodist University and Texas Christian University. I expected them to support the basic idea that blocking the merging of big companies is bad for consumers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeither one did. They're not buying the argument by regulators that consolidation is always bad for consumers.\n\nMost deals are done for the benefit of stockholders, not consumers, TCU's Audra Boone says. Promises that prices will drop, not rise, are almost impossible to prove, especially without a thorough economic analysis.\n\nRegulators argue that less competition automatically means higher prices.\n\nKroger/Albertsons counters, saying that by growing larger they become more efficient, and they can pass those savings on to consumers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSMU's Michael Davis says, \"It worries me a lot when lawyers in Washington look out there and say, 'OK, this is what's important in the grocery store.' The grocery store people are in a better position to know that than lawyers in Washington.\"\n\nDavis is critical of regulators' goals of \"creating a new kind of business landscape that, to put it bluntly, suits their taste. Even if there's really no harm to consumers, the FTC is happy to bring an antitrust lawsuit.\"\n\nBoone said these roadblocks put up to slow mergers down would likely not happen in a Republican administration.\n\nBiden appointed Lina M. Khan to chair the FTC. She said in one speech I read that her commission's aggressiveness, along with the DOJ, has deterred bankers and deal lawyers from launching \"illegal deals.\"\n\nAdvertisementKroger/Albertsons\n\nKroger wants to buy Albertsons in the biggest supermarket merger in history -- a $24.6 billion deal.\n\nThe FTC says it will hurt pricing, result in lower quality goods and services and hurt employees' wages, benefits and working conditions.\n\nAttorneys general in eight states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit to stop the deal. Texas is not one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn court papers, Albertsons argues it is bedeviled by competition from Walmart, Target, Costco, Amazon/Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and Sprouts.\n\nTo put sugar on top of the deal, Kroger/Albertsons say they would invest $500 million to cut prices and $1 billion to increase workers' pay and benefits and another $1.3 billion to update Albertsons stores.\n\nOn the joint KrogerAlbertsons.com website, Kroger promises: \"Kroger will not close any stores, distribution centers or manufacturing facilities or lay off any frontline associates as a result of the merger.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTCU's Boone says those most likely to get hurt are people living in areas without many grocery stores.\n\n\"Overall, it will be interesting to see how this plays out,\" she says. \"Most FTC claims do not result in a trial. Companies either abandon the deal or they are able to make enough concessions that the FTC offers it approval.\"\n\nMy takeaway: If the FTC wants to shutter the Kroger/Albertsons deal, it must do a better job of proving its claims of antitrust. Saying that consumers will automatically get hurt must be proven in the biggest deal in supermarket history. To me, it seems like the grocery market is already highly competitive.\n\nIt's a long way from the origins of Bernard Kroger and Joe Albertson to this $24 billion deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecome a citizen of Watchdog Nation.\n\nJoin Dave Lieber and learn to be a super-consumer.\n\nWatchdog newsletter: Sign up for The Watchdog's FREE weekly newsletter to keep up: click here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSubscribe: PLEASE support The Watchdog's brand of straightforward journalism designed to save you time, money and aggravation.

He also mentioned that most people, including George Lucas, support Iger, except for activist investor Nelson Peltz.\n\nWhen asked about the performance of Disney's streaming business, studios, and parks, Gerber expressed confidence in the company's direction, particularly in the wake of a significant reduction in spending on streaming and content production in Hollywood.\n\nSee Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Surge Amid Selling Pressure Over The Weekend: Analyst Says King Crypto To Rea\n\nHe also touched on the topic of Iger's successor, stating that he is unsure of a replacement due to Iger's exceptional leadership and physical condition.\n\nWhy It Matters: George Lucas's support comes at a crucial time for Disney, as the company is facing a proxy battle with activist investors. Lucas, the creator of the Star Wars franchise, is a significant figure in the entertainment industry, and his endorsement of Iger could potentially sway other shareholders.\n\nDisney has been making strategic moves to revitalize its business, including a recent studio overhaul to counter a box office downturn, as disclosed by Iger during an investor conference Q&A.\n\nDespite the challenges, the company has received support from influential figures within the industry, such as the grandchildren of Disney's founders, who have criticized and opposed the activist investors challenging the company's management.\n\nRead Next: Crypto Analyst Says Dogecoin Has Broken Macro Downtrend, Now Testing Support Between These Levels\n\nLoading...Loading...",

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Walt Disney Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "body": "The past three years have been challenging ones for Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS). Ditto for shareholders; the stock's still down more than 40% from its early 2021 peak.\n\nBlame the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly. The contagion reshaped the entertainment industry landscape by accelerating the growth of competing streaming services while at the same time permanently damaging the theatrical film business. Like most of its peers, Disney wasn't ready for the rapid change.\n\nTime eventually heals all wounds though. Now three years into the shakeup -- and with a veteran CEO back at the helm -- there's a light shining at the end of the tunnel. Walt Disney can be fixed, and the turnaround is already making progress.\n\nFour arguments stand out as reasons to take a swing on Disney stock sooner rather than later, before the recovery rally makes any more progress.\n\nWalt Disney is (finally) fixing streaming's profitability problem\n\nWhen Disney first launched its flagship streaming service Disney+ back in 2019, profits weren't a concern. The media giant's first goal was establishing market dominance. Making the platform profitable would be something for down the road.\n\nWell, the company is well down the road, but its streaming business (Disney+, ESPN+, and its stake in Hulu) is still in the red. The company's direct-to-consumer arm lost $216 million during the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30).\n\nThese losses are shrinking though and will likely continue doing so. As CFO Hugh Johnston commented during the company's latestearnings call \"We still expect to reach profitability at our combined streaming businesses in Q4 of fiscal 2024 and have never been more confident about our path to creating a strong and sustainable streaming business.\"\n\nThis underlying improvement is partially the result of cost cutting. But future progress will also reflect a more optimized mix of streaming services. Disney intends to acquire the one-third of Hulu it doesn't already own sometime this year, for instance, pushing co-owner Comcast all the way out of the picture so Disney can manage and promote the platform in a way the best suits it.\n\nIger knows why films have been disappointing of late\n\nPrior to the pandemic, Disney's film business was firing on all cylinders. In retrospect though, it appears the success was more about the franchises and intellectual property -- Star Wars and Marvel's Avengers -- than the filmmaking itself. The media giant's latest movies have been subpar, and its film business has also regularly been unprofitable.\n\nThat could be about to change, however. CEO Bob Iger conceded in an interview at last year's DealBook conference, \"[Disney's] creators lost sight of what their No. 1 objective needed to be. We have to entertain first. It's not about messages.\" He added, \"And I don't really want to tolerate the opposite.\"\n\nIt's still not entirely clear what that means in practical terms. It can take months to shoot a film and then many more months to edit and finalize it. The films being released right now are still largely those that were started under Iger's predecessor.\n\nNow a year and a half since Iger was renamed CEO, audiences should begin seeing more films in line with Iger's vision, which worked when he was first at the helm between 2005 and 2020.\n\nThe proxy fight with Nelson Peltz and Trian could force an overhaul\n\nGenerally speaking, proxy fights like the one Walt Disney and activist investor Nelson Peltz are currently in are a significant nuisance to the targeted company. But that's not always a bad thing. Sometimes, such a nuisance can bring about much needed change.\n\nActivist investing outfit Trian Partners -- led by Peltz -- is working to put at least three hand-picked directors on Disney's board. As Trian's message to shareholders explains: \"We believe restoring the magic at Disney starts with a focused, aligned and accountable board, intensely committed to returning an 'ownership mentality' to the boardroom. That, and a heavy dose of best-in-class corporate governance is the medicine Disney needs to fix its ailing shareholder returns.\" With enough of its own voting members on the board of directors, such change becomes much more likely.\n\nIger and Walt Disney are pushing back, of course. They ultimately want the same thing Peltz and all other shareholders want, a higher stock price. The two parties simply have a different vision about how that should happen.\n\nThe thing is, nuisance or not, this sort of highly publicized verbal sparring often motivates management to make necessary changes ... if only as a means of fending off an activist investor's efforts to take control of a company.\n\nDisney's brands are considered some of the best of the best\n\nLast but not least, while Walt Disney may be struggling right now, there's no denying the company's properties are some of the very best names in their respective businesses. Its theme parks are the gold standard within the theme park industry, for example, while ESPN enjoys cable television's highest carriage fees for good reason. Walt Disney also owns television network AMC and several other cable channels including National Geographic and FX.\n\nThen, there's its incredible catalog of film classics ranging from Snow White and Sleeping Beauty to more modern franchises like the aforementioned Avengers and Star Wars series. Even Trian believes Disney has \"unparalleled assets and opportunities and every reason to grow and prosper.\" It just hasn't been using capitalizing on them all that well of late.\n\nBut the potential is there.

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Walt Disney Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "body": "The past three years have been challenging ones for Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS). Ditto for shareholders; the stock's still down more than 40% from its early 2021 peak.\n\nBlame the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly. The contagion reshaped the entertainment industry landscape by accelerating the growth of competing streaming services while at the same time permanently damaging the theatrical film business. Like most of its peers, Disney wasn't ready for the rapid change.\n\nTime eventually heals all wounds though. Now three years into the shakeup -- and with a veteran CEO back at the helm -- there's a light shining at the end of the tunnel. Walt Disney can be fixed, and the turnaround is already making progress.\n\nFour arguments stand out as reasons to take a swing on Disney stock sooner rather than later, before the recovery rally makes any more progress.\n\nWhen Disney first launched its flagship streaming service Disney+ back in 2019, profits weren't a concern. The media giant's first goal was establishing market dominance. Making the platform profitable would be something for down the road.\n\nWell, the company is well down the road, but its streaming business (Disney+, ESPN+, and its stake in Hulu) is still in the red. The company's direct-to-consumer arm lost $216 million during the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30).\n\nThese losses are shrinking though and will likely continue doing so. As CFO Hugh Johnston commented during the company's latest earnings call, \"We still expect to reach profitability at our combined streaming businesses in Q4 of fiscal 2024 and have never been more confident about our path to creating a strong and sustainable streaming business.\"\n\nThis underlying improvement is partially the result of cost cutting. But future progress will also reflect a more optimized mix of streaming services. Disney intends to acquire the one-third of Hulu it doesn't already own sometime this year, for instance, pushing co-owner Comcast all the way out of the picture so Disney can manage and promote the platform in a way the best suits it.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, Disney's film business was firing on all cylinders. In retrospect though, it appears the success was more about the franchises and intellectual property -- Star Wars and Marvel's Avengers -- than the filmmaking itself. The media giant's latest movies have been subpar, and its film business has also regularly been unprofitable.\n\nThat could be about to change, however. CEO Bob Iger conceded in an interview at last year's DealBook conference, \"[Disney's] creators lost sight of what their No. 1 objective needed to be. We have to entertain first. It's not about messages.\" He added, \"And I don't really want to tolerate the opposite.\"\n\nIt's still not entirely clear what that means in practical terms. It can take months to shoot a film and then many more months to edit and finalize it. The films being released right now are still largely those that were started under Iger's predecessor.\n\nNow a year and a half since Iger was renamed CEO, audiences should begin seeing more films in line with Iger's vision, which worked when he was first at the helm between 2005 and 2020.\n\nGenerally speaking, proxy fights like the one Walt Disney and activist investor Nelson Peltz are currently in are a significant nuisance to the targeted company. But that's not always a bad thing. Sometimes, such a nuisance can bring about much needed change.\n\nActivist investing outfit Trian Partners -- led by Peltz -- is working to put at least three hand-picked directors on Disney's board. As Trian's message to shareholders explains: \"We believe restoring the magic at Disney starts with a focused, aligned and accountable board, intensely committed to returning an 'ownership mentality' to the boardroom. That, and a heavy dose of best-in-class corporate governance is the medicine Disney needs to fix its ailing shareholder returns.\" With enough of its own voting members on the board of directors, such change becomes much more likely.\n\nIger and Walt Disney are pushing back, of course. They ultimately want the same thing Peltz and all other shareholders want, a higher stock price. The two parties simply have a different vision about how that should happen.\n\nThe thing is, nuisance or not, this sort of highly publicized verbal sparring often motivates management to make necessary changes ... if only as a means of fending off an activist investor's efforts to take control of a company.\n\nLast but not least, while Walt Disney may be struggling right now, there's no denying the company's properties are some of the very best names in their respective businesses. Its theme parks are the gold standard within the theme park industry, for example, while ESPN enjoys cable television's highest carriage fees for good reason. Walt Disney also owns television network AMC and several other cable channels including National Geographic and FX.\n\nThen, there's its incredible catalog of film classics ranging from Snow White and Sleeping Beauty to more modern franchises like the aforementioned Avengers and Star Wars series. Even Trian believes Disney has \"unparalleled assets and opportunities and every reason to grow and prosper.\" It just hasn't been using capitalizing on them all that well of late.\n\nBut the potential is there. Whether it's Bob Iger who taps it or someone else, the ingredients needed to return the company to its former magic exist.\n\nConcerns remain, to be sure. For example, it's possible the planned $7.5 billion of cost cuts expected to be completed by the end of this year could prove more harmful than beneficial by crimping the company's ability to attract paying customers. There's also no denying the ongoing cable cord-cutting movement is working against Disney -- a headwind that may not be fully offset by the intended 2025 launch of a standalone streaming version of ESPN.\n\nOn balance though, for the first time in years, there's good reason for investors to be cautiously bullish on this stock.

        "title": "F-35 Vs F-22: Comparing & Contrasting The Iconic Lockheed Martin Fighter Jets",
        "body": "These two fighter jets are among the newest in the arsenal of the United States Air Force.\n\nSummary The F-22 Raptor outperforms the F-35 Lightning II in speed and climb rate, making it a formidable interceptor. The F-35's versatility in armament surpasses the F-22, enabling it to serve various missions, including nuclear deterrence and air-to-ground strikes. In terms of dogfighting capabilities, the F-22 shines as the best option for air-to-air combat, while the F-35 excels in modern combat scenarios that involve advanced communication and technology. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II has long been seen as the future of air power for three different branches of the United States Armed Forces. With three different variants that uniquely serve the United States Air Force, United States Navy, and United States Marine Corps, the jet has truly become the ultimate versatile fighting machine.\n\nHowever, when it comes to single-aircraft combat, or dogfighting as it is more commonly known, there is one aircraft that has a leg up on the ultra-modern jet. The F-22 Raptor stands as among the deadliest aircraft ever to enter the skies, and it is an all-weather, stealth-capable fighter built in collaboration between Lockheed Martin and American aerospace giant Boeing.\n\nPhoto: Aditya0635 | Shutterstock\n\nComparing America's two newest and deadliest fighter jets can be challenging, and trying to determine which one has the edge over the other in any specific category can also be difficult. In this article, we will take a deeper look at the extensive similarities and differences between the F-35 Lightning II and the F-22 Raptor.\n\nOperational capabilities\n\nIn terms of performance, both the F-35 and the F-22 offer the United States Air Force impressive speed, range, and endurance, although in some categories, one does stand out over the other. One of the key factors that is critical to fighter performance is speed, and here the F-22, which was designed specifically for air superiority, is a clear winner. Speed specifics for the F-22 are detailed in the table below:\n\nFlight type:\n\nSpeed:\n\nSupersonic cruising speed:\n\nMach 1.82\n\nMaximum speed at sea level:\n\nMach 1.21\n\nMaximum overall speed:\n\nMach 2.25\n\nDue to its impressive top speeds, there are extremely few combat aircraft in the skies today that are able to outrun the F-22, making it an incredibly capable interceptor. Despite being incredibly powerful, the F-35 Lightning II is unable to match the Raptor's speeds, topping out at a maximum speed of Mach 1.6, with a maximum sea level speed of just over Mach 1.\n\nPhoto: ranchorunner | Shutterstock\n\nAccording to the EurAsian Times, the F-22 is also able to beat out its rival in terms of climb rate, able to ascend at over 62,000 feet per minute. The F-35, by contrast, is only able to climb at around 45,000 feet per minute. In order to contextualize both of these figures, a typical Boeing 787 will exhibit a climb rate of between 2,000 and 3,000 directly after takeoff.\n\nKeep up with the latest Simple Flying coverage of military aviation here !\n\nInevitably, the F-22 was designed to be the deadliest dogfighter ever made, able to go toe-to-toe with the most advanced modern stealth fighters that an enemy might have to offer. Despite performing more weakly in terms of speed and climb, the F-35 is equipped with impressive stealth technology, allowing it to be an incredibly effective weapon against conventional non-stealth fighters.\n\nExamining the armament\n\nIn terms of armament, the F-35 is far more versatile than its faster counterpart, and can perform almost any kind of mission. While the F-22 may excel in one-on-one air-to-air combat, the F-35's superior versatility will allow it to serve more purposes, including nuclear deterrence and aerial strike missions.\n\nAccording to the National Interest, there are three key kinds of missions that the F-22 is incapable of performing, which the F-35 is well-suited for, namely:\n\nNuclear strike capabilities. Anti-ship operations. Air-to-ground strike initiatives.\n\nWhile the F-22 Raptor may not be optimized for ground strikes, that is not to say that it is not equipped with an impressive variety of weapons. The Raptor can carry six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-line-of-sight air-to-air missiles, with an additional two weapon bays, each equipped with an LAU-141/A launcher for Sidewinders of other air-to-air missiles.\n\nIn the event that a Raptor is to be used for ground strike operations, the plane can also be loaded with precision-guided bombs. Despite being so formidable, the F-22 has actually never shot down an enemy aircraft in combat.\n\nRelated What Is 'Beast Mode' On The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II? The Joint Strike Fighter can switch from stealthy to scary, depending on the mission.\n\nThe F-35 is capable of carrying a far broader range of weapons and can have them loaded on external hardpoints or in internal bays. Common surface strike weapons can include Paveway laser-guided bombs and land-attack missiles like the SPEAR-3.\n\nClose\n\nThe plane is also capable of operating with the JASSM cruise missile, as well as an array of anti-ship weapons. This is in no way an exhaustive list of F-35 armaments, and the aircraft is also able to carry and deliver the B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb, a weapon that can also be deployed by the F-15 and the F-16, according to Popular Mechanics.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAcross the board, the combination of the F-22 and the F-35 ensures that the United States Air Force is in good hands when handling any threat that an enemy may pose. Deciding exactly which aircraft to deploy in a given situation, however, will ultimately come down to exactly what the task will require.\n\nPhoto: AMMHPhotography | Shutterstock\n\nThe Raptor is undeniably the best dogfighter in the Air Force's arsenal today and is unmatched in terms of air-to-air combat capabilities. In the event that conflict was to break out with an enemy in possession of a capable stealth fighter, like China's Chengdu J-20, the F-22 would likely be the ideal aircraft to counter any aggression.\n\nRelated The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor: Everything You Need To Know The F-22 Raptor is a formidable stealth fighter in the US' arsenal of military fighter jets.\n\nHowever, most modern combat has not involved such aircraft, and across the board, it has involved relatively limited dogfighting. As a result, the F-35, with its impressive data connectivity and advanced coordinative technology, alongside its extensive versatility, has made it the aircraft of choice for all kinds of missions. But at the end of the day, if it's just one plane against another, the F-22 is tough to beat.",

        "title": "Skunk Works: What Does Lockheed Martin Do In Palmdale, California?",
        "body": "A review of the United States' leading aviation development firm.\n\nSummary Skunk Works developed iconic aircraft like the U-2, SR-71, and F-117A through innovative engineering. The development of the XP-80 jet fighter marked the birth of Skunk Works and set a high standard for rapid production. Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works continues to drive aviation innovation, creating stealthy aircraft, X-planes, and advanced avionics. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nLockheed Martin has a famous product development shop in Palmdale, California, known as Skunk Works. From Skunk Works has come at least the XP-80 early jet fighter, U-2 and SR-71 spy planes, the F-117A Nighthawk, the F-22 Raptor, the F-35 Lightning II, and multiple stealthy uncrewed aircraft.\n\nA Skunk Works initially to develop America's first jet fighter\n\nReviewing Lockheed Martin's official history, the first official Lockheed product developed by Spunk Works was the World War II XP-80 in 1943 in response to the Luftwaffe's Me-262. The Me-262 was the first mass-produced jet fighter, as per the below guide.\n\nRelated The World's First Fighter Jet: A Look At The Messerschmitt Me 262 A brief history of the Me 262's development, with views by top British and German pilots.\n\nThe XP-80 would be Kelly Johnson's first jet, developed in 143 days - less than the 150 days granted. Although the XP-80 did not see combat in World War II, P-80 variants did see combat in the Korean War from 1950-1953, doing both air superiority and ground attack roles.\n\nPhoto: Grossinger | Shutterstock.com\n\nArmament:\n\nSix .50-cal. machine guns and eight 5-in. rockets or 2,000 lbs. of bombs\n\nEngine:\n\nAllison J33 of 5,400 lbs. thrust\n\nMaximum speed:\n\n580 mph\n\nCruising speed:\n\n437 mph\n\nRange:\n\n1,090 miles\n\nCeiling:\n\n46,800 ft.\n\nSpan:\n\n38 ft. 10 1/2 in.\n\nLength:\n\n34 ft. 6 in.\n\nHeight:\n\n11 ft. 4 in.\n\nWeight:\n\n16,856 lbs. maximum\n\nThe Skunk Works name was born at this time from an Al Capp's newspaper comic strip, which was about a secret place in the woods brewing beverages from skunks, old shoes, and other wild ingredients. When engineer Irv Culver answered the phone and said he worked for Skunk Works, the name stuck - especially as the P-80's development had to be a US national security secret at the time.\n\nGraphic: Lockheed Martin\n\nFurthermore, as pictured above, Kelly Johnson developed 14 rules for operating Skunk Rules. Lockheed Martin says these rules still apply today, such as rule 12:\n\n\"There must be mutual trust between the military project organization and the contractor, as well as very close cooperation and liaison on a day-to-day basis. This cuts down misunderstanding and correspondence to an absolute minimum.\"\n\nDeveloping the timeless U-2\n\nThe Skunk Works is most famous for developing spyplanes like the U-2 \"Dragon Lady\" high-altitude spy plane in 1954 that could fly above Soviet air defenses until Soviet air defenses caught up. The U-2's ability to operate at 70,000 ft (21.336 km) is still valuable today, even 70 years later, and many upgrades later.\n\nPhoto: viper-zero | Shutterstock.com\n\nPower plant:\n\nOne General Electric F118-101 engine\n\nThrust:\n\n17,000 pounds\n\nWingspan:\n\n105 feet (32 meters)\n\nLength:\n\n63 feet (19.2 meters)\n\nHeight:\n\n16 feet (4.8 meters)\n\nWeight:\n\n16,000 pounds\n\nMaximum takeoff weight:\n\n40,000 pounds (18,000 kilograms)\n\nFuel capacity:\n\n2,950 gallons\n\nPayload:\n\n5,000 pounds\n\nSpeed:\n\n410 mph\n\nRange:\n\nMore than 7,000 miles (6,090 nautical miles)\n\nCeiling:\n\nAbove 70,000 feet (21,212+ meters)\n\nOne should note that the many variants of U-2 can carry many sensors, such as wide-angle cameras, telephoto cameras, electromagnetic sensors to scoop up signals, and even air sensors to monitor air pollution. But its intended replacement would not be so versatile or last so long.\n\nCreating a Mach 3 spyplane\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency wanted a low-observable spy plane that could fly at Mach 3. The aircraft was developed originally as A-12, even though A stands for Attack. Eventually, it would become the SR-71 Blackbird, designed to fly at Mach 3 and refract radar returns to increase its ability to conduct reconnaissance worldwide.\n\nPhoto: USAF\n\nAccording to SR-71.org, Skunk Works got the CIA order on January 26th, 1960, and by April 30th, 1962, they had a formal first flight. By May 2nd, the A-12 went supersonic; on July 20th, it exceeded Mach 3 - 3 times the speed of sound. In November, the design speed and altitude were met.\n\nEngines:\n\nTwo Pratt & Whitney J58s of 32,500 lbs. thrust each with afterburner\n\nCrew:\n\nTwo\n\nMaximum speed:\n\nMach 3+ (three times the speed of sound) or over 2,000 mph\n\nRange:\n\nMore than 2,900 statute miles\n\nCeiling:\n\nOver 85,000 ft.\n\nSpan:\n\n55 ft. 7 in.\n\nLength:\n\n107 ft. 5 in.\n\nHeight:\n\n18 ft. 6 in.\n\nWeight:\n\n140,000 lbs. loaded\n\nPhoto: Jose Gil | Shutterstock\n\nBut the U-2 shootdown of May 1st, 1960, would result in standing orders from multiple United States Presidents to not overfly the Soviet Union to prevent another tragedy and risk of escalation between the nuclear powers. As a result, the A-12 became the SR-71.\n\nRelated Fastest Manned Aircraft In The World: A Look At The SR-71 Blackbird The aircraft shattered records and climbed to new heights.\n\nThe SR-71 would come with peripheral cameras to peek over the borders to eliminate the need for dangerous and unwelcome overflights. Additionally, the SR-71 could pack radars to map through clouds and, therefore, use another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to create visuals.\n\nRelated Faster Than A Bullet: What's The SR-71 Blackbird's Top Speed? The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird is retired and being relpaced by the SR-72 UAV.\n\nAdditionally, it is the world's highest and fastest production aircraft - not just would the CIA and US Air Force would operate SR-71s and NASA for high-speed and high-altitude research. The SR-71 would have a final flight on October 9th, 1999, for an Edwards Air Force Base open house - but in the care of NASA pilots.\n\nPivoting to develop a stealthy attack plane\n\nThe next major project of the Skunk Works would not be higher or faster but stealthier. Skunk Works was able to innovate to develop the F-117A Nighthawk - a subsonic, twin-engine jet that would reflect radar waves away from the source.\n\nSkunk Works would use many off-the-shelf parts to reduce development risk, integrating stealth design and adding laser designators and infrared tracking. The result would be a weapon platform that could carry two precision weapons or air-to-air missiles.\n\nClose\n\nThe F-117A first flew on June 18th, 1981, only 31 months after a US Air Force contract, saw combat in both 1991 and 2003 against Iraq as well as 1999 against Serbia, and is still flying in small numbers for scrimmaging and testing against low-observable aircraft. The work on the F-117A would lead to further projects to create stealthy aircraft by Skunk Works.\n\nSkunk Works also works on X-planes.\n\nSkunk Works also was a key player in developing the X-35 prototype for the Joint Strike Fighter. The X-35 would win the 2001 competition and become upscaled to be the F-35. The X-35 would win partly because Lockheed Martin could conduct a Hat Trick test of taking off vertically, going supersonically, and landing vertically - a feat no other airplane could do before.\n\nBut the X-35 was and is not Skunk Work's only X-plane. Skunk Works has worked on and is working on X Planes - or highly experimental aircraft - for NASA, like the X-59, which is meant to find an aerodynamic shape good enough for quiet supersonic flight. Thereby in the 2020s, building on the 1960s for a low observable supersonic spy plane - and all the work since.\n\nRelated NASA and Lockheed Martin Unveil X-59 Supersonic Jet The aircraft will test new technologies to reduce the sonic boom to a dull thud and gather data to support eventual supersonic flights over land.\n\nSkunk Works has also worked on drones like the X-44A Flying Wing Drone. This has led to several long-endurance, low-observable drones like the RQ-170 Sentinel that are about to replace the U-2 and other human-flown surveillance platforms.\n\nSkunk Works also develops avionics\n\nSkunk Works is also credited with developing avionics like Auto GCAS or Ground Collision Avoidance System. Auto GCAS, according to Lockheed Martin, has already saved no less than nine aircraft. The software notices that the aircraft is heading too close to terrain away from an airport and that the pilot is not responding to warnings. So, the aircraft takes over control to get straight and level automatically.\n\nYes, Skunk Works may have worked on something other than the original F-16 50 years ago, as General Dynamics developed the F-16 before Lockheed Martin purchased the firm. Auto GCAS is also part of the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning family as standard equipment.\n\nKeep up with the latest Simple Flying coverage of military aviation here .\n\nBut the firm is now developing technology that will make aviation safer - including an air collision prevention system as profiled below at 25 minutes of this Fighter Pilot Podcast episode with former Lockheed Martin test pilot Billie Flynn as a guest host:\n\nAlthough mid-air collisions are thankfully rare, the ability to intervene to prevent mid-air is a logical extension of Auto GCAS. These technologies are easily transferrable into commercial aviation.\n\nBottom line\n\nSkunk Works of Lockheed Martin has pushed aviation faster, higher, and stealthier since 1943 - with more projects than listed here. No longer replying to adversaries to setting standards, Skunk Works also made aviation safer and has been the United States' most innovative research and development shop. Additionally, according to an August 10th, 2021, Lockheed Martin statement, Skunk Works now has a 215,000-square-foot intelligent, flexible factory with the latest in digital production devices. For instance, the facility enjoys,\n\n\"Merging the power of human and machine, manufacturing artisans will work with digital tools to execute operations with maximum efficiency. The incorporation of robotics, artificial intelligence and augmented reality reduces the need for hard tooling, elevating the human experience to drive rapid innovation, a hallmark of the Skunk Works.\"\n\nBut Skunk Works has also left space for other aviation firms to innovate, something we will discuss soon.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

        "title": "What Is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC) / Freddie Mac?",
        "body": "Rebecca McClay has 10+ years of experience writing and editing content. Rebecca is an expert in personal finance, business, and financial markets.\n\nThe Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC), or Freddie Mac, is a stockholder-owned, government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) chartered by Congress in 1970 to keep money flowing to mortgage lenders, which in turn supports homeownership and rental housing for middle-income Americans.\n\nFreddie Mac purchases, guarantees, and securitizes home loans and is a mainstay of the secondary mortgage market.\n\nHistory of Freddie Mac\n\nFreddie Mac was created when Congress passed the Emergency Home Finance Act in 1970. A wholly owned subsidiary of the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLBS), it represented an attempt to reduce interest rate risk for savings and loans associations and smaller banks.\n\nIn 1989, under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), Freddie Mac underwent a reorganization. It became a publicly owned company, with shares that could trade on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 2008, during the financial crisis sparked by the subprime mortgage meltdown, the U.S. government -- specifically, the Federal Housing Finance Agency -- took over the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Though Freddie Mac is gradually transitioning toward independence, it remains under federal conservatorship.\n\nHow Freddie Mac Works\n\nThe Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, was created to enhance the flow of credit to different parts of the economy. Along with Fannie Mae, it is a key player in the secondary mortgage market.\n\nFreddie Mac doesn't originate or service home mortgages. Rather, it buys home loans from banks and other commercial mortgage lenders (giving these institutions funds that they can then use to finance more loans and mortgages). These loans must meet certain standards that Freddie Mac sets.\n\nAfter purchasing a large number of these mortgages, Freddie Mac either holds them in its own portfolio or combines and sells them as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to investors who are seeking a steady income stream. Either way, it \"insures\" these mortgages -- that is, it guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the loans. As a result, securities issued by Freddie Mac tend to be very liquid and carry a credit rating close to that of U.S. Treasuries.\n\nCriticism of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC)\n\nFreddie Mac has come under criticism because its ties to the U.S. government allow it to borrow money at interest rates lower than those available to other financial institutions. With this funding advantage, it issues large amounts of debt (known in the marketplace as \"agency debt\" or \"agencies\"), and in turn purchases and holds a huge portfolio of mortgages known as its \"retained portfolio.\"\n\nCritics have argued that the unchecked growth of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae led to the credit crisis of 2008 that plunged the U.S. into the Great Recession. In response, advocates of the enterprises argue that, while Freddie and Fannie made bad business decisions and held insufficient capital during the housing bubble, their portfolios made up only a tiny fraction of total subprime loans.\n\nFreddie Mac vs. Fannie Mae\n\nFannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association or FNMA) was created in 1938 as part of an amendment to the National Housing Act. It was considered a federal government agency, and its role was to act as a secondary mortgage market that could purchase, hold, or sell loans that were insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Fannie Mae stopped being a federal government agency and became a private-public corporation under the Charter Act of 1954.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are very similar. Both are publicly traded companies that were chartered to serve a public mission. The main difference between the two comes down to the source of the mortgages they buy.\n\nFannie Mae buys mortgage loans from major retail or commercial banks, while Freddie Mac buys its loans from smaller banks, often called \"thrift banks\" or \"savings and loan associations,\" that are focused on providing banking services to communities.\n\nThe Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC), or Freddie Mac, plays a crucial role in the housing market by backing loans to borrowers. Freddie Mac does not lend to borrowers directly, but backs mortgages so that lenders will be encouraged to approve loans. However, you still must meet certain standards to qualify for a mortgage guaranteed by Freddie Mac.",

        "body": "Loading...Loading...\n\nLAS VEGAS, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Freddie Mac FMCC and Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. ICE, a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced they're working together to bring greater loan quality to the mortgage origination process so lenders can effectively serve more borrowers while reducing risk. The collaboration will leverage both companies' automation technologies and solutions to help lenders quickly and efficiently underwrite mortgage loans starting at the point of sale.\n\n\"We're joining forces with ICE to combine our organizations' unique strengths to help more lenders deliver higher quality mortgages in this challenging market,\" said Kevin Kauffman, Freddie Mac Single-Family Senior Vice President of Seller Engagement. \"Our collaboration with ICE builds upon Freddie Mac's commitment to improve loan quality from origination through delivery so we can help reduce defects, lower costs and bring greater efficiency to the mortgage origination process.\"\n\nThe announcement was made during the ICE Experience 2024 conference, an annual event that gathers together thousands of leaders in the real estate and housing finance industries to showcase the latest technologies driving the digital mortgage market forward, from ICE as well as other industry participants.\n\n\"ICE is on a mission to make the path to homeownership as fast, transparent, accessible, and simple as possible,\" said Tim Bowler, President of ICE's mortgage technology division. \"Our innovations are targeting core issues associated with the cost and turn times of mortgage origination. We're proud to collaborate with Freddie Mac on the critical matter of improving loan quality to streamline the housing finance market and help minimize related repurchases.\"\n\nOver the last two years, Freddie Mac has announced automated capabilities that allow lenders to use asset and employment data to verify a borrower's assets, income and employment, as well as consider cash flow and rent payment history in the risk assessment.\n\nKauffman added, \"As more lenders consider adopting digital tools to mitigate risk and drive improvement in overall loan quality and portfolio performance, this effort signifies the next level of industry collaboration.\"\n\nRecent analysis shows that loans originated by lenders leveraging certain Freddie Mac automated offerings are up to four times less likely to produce defects than loans without these technology offerings. Process automation is especially beneficial for documenting income, both in the collection and assessment process. That's vitally important because income verification issues account for nearly one-third of all purchase transaction defects.\n\nAbout Freddie Mac\n\nFreddie Mac's mission is to make home possible for families across the nation.

        "body": "The amount you will be paid on your securities is based on the performance of the EURO STOXX 50\u00ae Index. The securities are unsecured notes issued by GS Finance Corp. and guaranteed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. If the closing level of the index on the determination date (the final index level) is greater than the initial index level (set on March 18, 2024 and may be higher or lower than the closing level of the index on the trade date), then the return on your securities will be positive and equal the product of the index return (the percentage increase or decrease in the final index level from the initial index level) multiplied by the upside gearing. If the final index level is equal to or less than the initial index level but greater than or equal to the downside threshold, you will receive the face amount of your securities at maturity. If the final index level is less than the downside threshold, the return on your securities will be negative and you will lose 1.00% of the face amount of your securities for every 1.00% decline in the level of the index beyond the downside threshold. You will receive less than the face amount of your securities and you will lose 80.00% of your investment in the securities if the final index level is zero.\n\nInvesting in the securities involves significant risks. You may lose a significant portion of your investment. The contingent repayment of principal applies only at maturity. Any payment on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the creditworthiness of GS Finance Corp. and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\n\n* The initial index level represents the closing level of the index on March 18, 2024 and may be higher or lower than the actual closing level of the index on the trade date.\n\nThe estimated value of your securities at the time the terms of your securities are set on the trade date is expected to be between $9.20 and $9.50 per $10 face amount. For a discussion of the estimated value and the price at which Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC would initially buy or sell your securities, if it makes a market in the securities, see page PS-2.\n\nNeither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any other regulatory body has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this pricing supplement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. The securities are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.\n\nAmendment No. 1 to Pricing Supplement No. dated , 2024.\n\nThe issue price, underwriting discount and net proceeds listed above relate to the securities we sell initially. We may decide to sell additional securities after the date of this pricing supplement , at issue prices and with underwriting discounts and net proceeds that differ from the amounts set forth above. The return (whether positive or negative) on your investment in securities will depend in part on the issue price you pay for such securities.\n\nGS Finance Corp. may use this prospectus in the initial sale of the securities. In addition, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC or any other affiliate of GS Finance Corp. may use this prospectus in a market-making transaction in a security after its initial sale. Unless GS Finance Corp. or its agent informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale, this prospectus is being used in a market-making transaction.\n\nMinimum Purchase Amount of Securities Offered Hereby\n\nIn connection with the initial offering of the securities, the minimum face amount of securities that may be purchased by any investor is $1,000.\n\nINVESTING IN THE SECURITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT RISKS. YOU MAY LOSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE SECURITIES. ANY PAYMENT ON THE SECURITIES IS SUBJECT TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF GS FINANCE CORP. AND THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. IF GS FINANCE CORP. AND THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. WERE TO DEFAULT ON THEIR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE ANY AMOUNTS OWED TO YOU UNDER THE SECURITIES AND YOU COULD LOSE YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT.\n\nThe following examples are provided for purposes of illustration only. They should not be taken as an indication or prediction of future investment results and are intended merely to illustrate the impact that various hypothetical final underlying index levels on the determination date could have on the cash settlement amount at maturity assuming all other variables remain constant.\n\nThe examples below are based on a range of final underlying index levels that are entirely hypothetical; no one can predict what the underlying index level will be on any day throughout the life of your securities, and no one can predict what the final underlying index level will be on the determination date. The underlying index has been highly volatile in the past -- meaning that the underlying index levels have changed substantially in relatively short periods -- and its performance cannot be predicted for any future period.\n\nThe information in the following examples reflects hypothetical rates of return on the offered securities assuming that they are purchased on the original issue date at the face amount and held to the stated maturity date. If you sell your securities in a secondary market prior to the stated maturity date, your return will depend upon the market value of your securities at the time of sale, which may be affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the examples below such as interest rates, the volatility of the underlying index, the creditworthiness of GS Finance Corp., as issuer, and the creditworthiness of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., as guarantor. In addition, the estimated value of your securities at the time the terms of your securities are set on the trade date (as determined by reference to pricing models used by GS&Co.) is less than the original issue price of your securities. For more information on the estimated value of your securities, see \"Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Securities -- The Estimated Value of Your Securities At the Time the Terms of Your Securities Are Set On the Trade Date (as Determined By Reference to Pricing Models Used By GS&Co.) Is Less Than the Original Issue Price Of Your Securities\" on page PS-10 of this pricing supplement.\n\nFor these reasons, the actual performance of the underlying index over the life of your securities, as well as the amount payable at maturity may bear little relation to the hypothetical examples shown below or to the historical index levels shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement. For information about the underlying index levels during recent periods, see \"The Underlying Index -- Historical Closing Levels of the Underlying Index\" on page PS-18. Before investing in the securities, you should\n\nconsult publicly available information to determine the underlying index levels between the date of this pricing supplement and the date of your purchase of the securities.\n\nAlso, the hypothetical examples shown below do not take into account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to your securities, tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your securities to a comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the underlying index stocks.\n\nThe levels in the left column of the table below represent hypothetical final underlying index levels and are expressed as percentages of the initial underlying index level. The amounts in the right column represent the hypothetical cash settlement amounts, based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlying index level, and are expressed as percentages of the face amount of a security (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of a percent). Thus, a hypothetical cash settlement amount of 100.000% means that the value of the cash payment that we would deliver for each $10 of the outstanding face amount of the offered securities on the stated maturity date would equal 100.000% of the face amount of a security, based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlying index level and the assumptions noted above.\n\nIf, for example, the final underlying index level were determined to be 25.000% of the initial underlying index level, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your securities at maturity would be 45.000% of the face amount of your securities, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your securities on the original issue date at the face amount and held them to the stated maturity date, you would lose 55.000% of your investment, which is equivalent to losing 1.000% of the face amount of your securities for every 1.000% that the decline in the underlying index from the trade date to the determination date exceeds 80.000% (if you purchased your securities at a premium to face amount you would lose a correspondingly higher percentage of your investment). Alternatively, if, for example, the final underlying index level were determined to be 95.000% of the initial underlying index level, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your securities at maturity would be 100.000% of the face amount of your securities, as shown in the table above.\n\nThe following chart also shows a graphical illustration of the hypothetical cash settlement amounts (expressed as a percentage of the face amount of your securities) that we would pay on your securities on the stated maturity date, if the final underlying index level were any of the hypothetical levels shown on the horizontal axis. The chart shows that any hypothetical final underlying index level of less than 80.000% (the section left of the 80.000% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a hypothetical cash settlement amount of less than 100.000% of the face amount of your securities (the section below the 100.000% marker on the vertical axis) and, accordingly, in a loss of principal on the securities..\n\nThe cash settlement amounts shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on hypothetical market prices for the underlying index stocks that may not be achieved on the determination date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your securities on the stated maturity date or at any other time, including any time you may wish to sell your securities, may bear little relation to the hypothetical cash settlement amounts shown above, and these amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in any offered securities. The hypothetical cash settlement amounts on securities held to the stated maturity date in the examples above assume you purchased your securities at their face amount and have not been adjusted to reflect the actual issue price you pay for your securities. The return on your investment (whether positive or negative) in your securities will be affected by the amount you pay for your securities. If you purchase your securities for a price other than the face amount, the return on your investment will differ from, and may be significantly lower than, the hypothetical returns suggested by the above examples. Please read \"Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Securities -- The Market Value of Your Securities May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors\" on page PS-13.\n\nPayments on the securities are economically equivalent to the amounts that would be paid on a combination of other instruments. For example, payments on the securities are economically equivalent to a bond bought by the holder and one or more options entered into between the holder and us. Therefore, the terms of the securities may be impacted by the various factors mentioned under \"Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Securities -- The Market Value of Your Securities May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors\" on page PS-13. The discussion in this paragraph does not modify or affect the terms of the securities or the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the securities, as described elsewhere in this pricing supplement.\n\nAn investment in your securities is subject to the risks described below, as well as the risks and considerations described in the accompanying prospectus, in the accompanying prospectus supplement, under \"Additional Risk Factors Specific to the Securities\" in the accompanying underlier supplement and under \"Additional Risk Factors Specific to the Notes\" in the accompanying general terms supplement. You should carefully review these risks and considerations as well as the terms of the securities described herein and in the accompanying prospectus, the accompanying prospectus supplement, the accompanying underlier supplement and the accompanying general terms supplement. Your securities are a riskier investment than ordinary debt securities. Also, your securities are not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying index stocks, i.e., the stocks comprising the underlying index to which your securities are linked. You should carefully consider whether the offered securities are appropriate given your particular circumstances.\n\nWithout limiting the foregoing, for certain risks and considerations related to conflicts of interest, including calculation agent discretion and hedging activities, see \"Additional Risk Factors Specific to the Notes -- Risks Related to Structure, Valuation and Secondary Market Sales -- The Calculation Agent Will Have the Authority to Make Determinations That Could Affect the Market Value of Your Notes, When Your Notes Mature and the Amount, If Any, Payable on Your Notes\" and \"Additional Risk Factors Specific to the Notes -- Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest -- Hedging Activities by Goldman Sachs or Our Distributors May Negatively Impact Investors in the Notes and Cause Our Interests and Those of Our Clients and Counterparties to be Contrary to Those of Investors in the Notes\" in the accompanying general terms supplement.\n\nRisks Related to Structure, Valuation and Secondary Market Sales\n\nThe original issue price for your securities exceeds the estimated value of your securities as of the time the terms of your securities are set on the trade date, as determined by reference to GS&Co.'s pricing models and taking into account our credit spreads. Such estimated value on the trade date is set forth above under \"Estimated Value of Your Securities\"; after the trade date, the estimated value as determined by reference to these models will be affected by changes in market conditions, the creditworthiness of GS Finance Corp., as issuer, the creditworthiness of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., as guarantor, and other relevant factors. The price at which GS&Co. would initially buy or sell your securities (if GS&Co. makes a market, which it is not obligated to do), and the value that GS&Co. will initially use for account statements and otherwise, also exceeds the estimated value of your securities as determined by reference to these models. As agreed by GS&Co. and the distribution participants, this excess (i.e., the additional amount described under \"Estimated Value of Your Securities\") will decline to zero on a straight line basis over the period set forth above under \"Estimated Value of Your Securities\". Thereafter, if GS&Co. buys or sells your securities it will do so at prices that reflect the estimated value determined by reference to such pricing models at that time. The price at which GS&Co. will buy or sell your securities at any time also will reflect its then current bid and ask spread for similar sized trades of structured securities.\n\nIn estimating the value of your securities as of the time the terms of your securities are set on the trade date, as disclosed above under \"Estimated Value of Your Securities\", GS&Co.'s pricing models consider certain variables, including principally our credit spreads, interest rates (forecasted, current and historical rates), volatility, price-sensitivity analysis and the time to maturity of the securities. These pricing models are proprietary and rely in part on certain assumptions about future events, which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, the actual value you would receive if you sold your securities in the secondary market, if any, to others may differ, perhaps materially, from the estimated value of your securities determined by reference to our models due to, among other things, any differences in\n\npricing models or assumptions used by others. See \" -- The Market Value of Your Securities May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors\" below.\n\nThe difference between the estimated value of your securities as of the time the terms of your securities are set on the trade date and the original issue price is a result of certain factors, including principally the underwriting discount and commissions, the expenses incurred in creating, documenting and marketing the securities, and an estimate of the difference between the amounts we pay to GS&Co. and the amounts GS&Co. pays to us in connection with your securities. We pay to GS&Co. amounts based on what we would pay to holders of a non-structured security with a similar maturity. In return for such payment, GS&Co. pays to us the amounts we owe under your securities.\n\nIn addition to the factors discussed above, the value and quoted price of your securities at any time will reflect many factors and cannot be predicted. If GS&Co. makes a market in the securities, the price quoted by GS&Co. would reflect any changes in market conditions and other relevant factors, including any deterioration in our creditworthiness or perceived creditworthiness or the creditworthiness or perceived creditworthiness of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. These changes may adversely affect the value of your securities, including the price you may receive for your securities in any market making transaction. To the extent that GS&Co. makes a market in the securities, the quoted price will reflect the estimated value determined by reference to GS&Co.'s pricing models at that time, plus or minus its then current bid and ask spread for similar sized trades of structured securities (and subject to the declining excess amount described above).\n\nFurthermore, if you sell your securities, you will likely be charged a commission for secondary market transactions, or the price will likely reflect a dealer discount. This commission or discount will further reduce the proceeds you would receive for your securities in a secondary market sale.\n\nThere is no assurance that GS&Co. or any other party will be willing to purchase your securities at any price and, in this regard, GS&Co. is not obligated to make a market in the securities. See \" -- Your Securities May Not Have an Active Trading Market\" below.\n\nAlthough the return on the securities will be based on the performance of the underlying index, the payment of any amount due on the securities is subject to the credit risk of GS Finance Corp., as issuer of the securities, and the credit risk of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., as guarantor of the securities. The securities are our unsecured obligations. Investors are dependent on our ability to pay all amounts due on the securities, and therefore investors are subject to our credit risk and to changes in the market's view of our creditworthiness. Similarly, investors are dependent on the ability of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., as guarantor of the securities, to pay all amounts due on the securities, and therefore are also subject to its credit risk and to changes in the market's view of its creditworthiness. See \"Description of the Notes We May Offer -- Information About Our Medium-Term Notes, Series F Program -- How the Notes Rank Against Other Debt\" on page S-5 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and \"Description of Debt Securities We May Offer -- Guarantee by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\" on page 67 of the accompanying prospectus.\n\nYou can lose a substantial portion of your investment in the securities. The cash settlement amount on your securities on the stated maturity date will be based on the performance of the underlying index as measured from the initial underlying index level set on March 18, 2024 to the closing level of the underlying index on the determination date. If the final underlying index level is less than the downside threshold (i.e., the final underlying index level has declined, relative to the initial underlying index level, by more than the buffer), you will have a loss for each $10 of the face amount of your securities equal to the product of $10 times the sum of the underlying index return plus the buffer. As specified elsewhere in this pricing supplement, if the final underlying index level declines, relative to the initial underlying index level, by more than the buffer, you will lose 1% of the face amount of your securities for every 1% that such decline exceeds the buffer. Thus, you may lose a substantial portion\n\nof your investment in the securities, which would include any premium to face amount you paid when you purchased the securities.\n\nAlso, the application of the buffer applies only at maturity and the market price of your securities prior to the stated maturity date may be significantly lower than the purchase price you pay for your securities. Consequently, if you sell your securities before the stated maturity date, you may receive far less than the amount of your investment in the securities even if the level of the underlying index is not below the downside threshold at the time of sale.\n\nThe final underlying index level will be based on the closing level of the underlying index on the determination date (subject to adjustment as described elsewhere in this pricing supplement). Therefore, if the closing level of the underlying index dropped precipitously on the determination date, the cash settlement amount for your securities may be significantly less than it would have been had the cash settlement amount been linked to the closing level of the underlying index prior to such drop in the level of the underlying index. Although the actual level of the underlying index on the stated maturity date or at other times during the life of your securities may be higher than the final underlying index level, you will not benefit from the closing level of the underlying index at any time other than on the determination date.\n\nYou will not receive any interest payments on your securities. As a result, even if the cash settlement amount payable for each of your securities on the stated maturity date exceeds the face amount of your securities, the overall return you earn on your securities may be less than you would have earned by investing in a non-indexed debt security of comparable maturity that bears interest at a prevailing market rate.\n\nThe economic terms for the securities, including the downside threshold, are based, in part, on the expected volatility of the underlying index at the time the terms of the securities are set. \"Volatility\" refers to the frequency and magnitude of changes in the level of the underlying index.\n\nHigher expected volatility with respect to the underlying index as of the trade date generally indicates a greater expectation as of that date that the final underlying index level could ultimately be less than the downside threshold on the determination date, which would result in a loss of a significant portion of your investment in the securities. At the time the terms of the securities are set, higher expected volatility will generally be reflected in a lower downside threshold, as compared to otherwise comparable securities issued by the same issuer with the same maturity but with one or more different underlying indices. However, there is no guarantee that the lower downside threshold set for your securities on the trade date will adequately compensate you, from a risk-potential reward perspective, for the greater risk of losing a significant portion of your investment in the securities.\n\nA relatively lower downside threshold (as compared to otherwise comparable securities), which would\n\nincrease the buffer against the loss of principal, may generally indicate an increased risk that the level of the underlying index will decrease substantially. This would result in a significant loss at maturity if the final underlying index level is less than the downside threshold. Further, a relatively lower downside threshold may not indicate that the securities have a greater likelihood of a return of principal at maturity based on the performance of the underlying index.\n\nYou should not take the historical volatility of the underlying index as an indication of its future volatility. You should be willing to accept the downside market risk of the underlying index and the potential to lose a significant portion of your investment at maturity.\n\nWhen we refer to the market value of your securities, we mean the value that you could receive for your securities if you chose to sell them in the open market before the stated maturity date. A number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and impact the value of bonds and options generally, will influence the market value of your securities, including:\n\n\uf0b7 the level of the underlying index;\n\n\uf0b7 the volatility -- i.e., the frequency and magnitude of changes -- in the level of the underlying index;\n\n\uf0b7 the dividend rates of the underlying index stocks;\n\n\uf0b7 economic, financial, regulatory, political, military, public health and other events that affect stock markets generally and the underlying index stocks, and which may affect the level of the underlying index;\n\n\uf0b7 interest rates and yield rates in the market;\n\n\uf0b7 the time remaining until your securities mature; and\n\n\uf0b7 our creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., whether actual or perceived, and including actual or anticipated upgrades or downgrades in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. or changes in other credit measures.\n\nWithout limiting the foregoing, the market value of your securities may be negatively impacted by increasing interest rates. Such adverse impact of increasing interest rates could be significantly enhanced in securities with longer-dated maturities, the market values of which are generally more sensitive to increasing interest rates.\n\nThese factors, and many other factors, will influence the price you will receive if you sell your securities before maturity, including the price you may receive for your securities in any market-making transaction. If you sell your securities before maturity, you may receive less than the face amount of your securities.\n\nYou cannot predict the future performance of the underlying index based on its historical performance. The actual performance of the underlying index over the life of the offered securities and the cash settlement amount paid on the stated maturity date may bear little or no relation to the historical closing levels of the underlying index or to the hypothetical examples shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement.\n\nYour securities will not be listed or displayed on any securities exchange or included in any interdealer market quotation system, and there may be little or no secondary market for your securities. Even if a secondary market for your securities develops, it may not provide significant liquidity and we expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result, the difference between bid and asked prices for your securities in any secondary market could be substantial.\n\nThe cash settlement amount you will be paid for your securities on the stated maturity date will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for the securities. If you purchase securities at a price that\n\ndiffers from the face amount of the securities, then the return on your investment in such securities held to the stated maturity date will differ from, and may be substantially less than, the return on securities purchased at face amount. If you purchase your securities at a premium to face amount and hold them to the stated maturity date the return on your investment in the securities will be lower than it would have been had you purchased the securities at face amount or a discount to face amount. In addition, the impact of the downside threshold on the return on your investment will depend upon the price you pay for your securities relative to face amount. For example, the downside threshold, while still limiting some downside exposure to the underlying index, will allow a greater percentage decrease in your investment in the securities than would have been the case for securities purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount.\n\nInvesting in your securities will not make you a holder of any of the underlying index stocks. Neither you nor any other holder or owner of your securities will have any rights with respect to the underlying index stocks, including any voting rights, any rights to receive dividends or other distributions, any rights to make a claim against the underlying index stocks or any other rights of a holder of the underlying index stocks. Your securities will be paid in cash and you will have no right to receive delivery of any underlying index stocks.\n\nAt our sole option, we may decide to sell an additional aggregate face amount of the securities subsequent to the date of this pricing supplement. The issue price of the securities in the subsequent sale may differ substantially (higher or lower) from the issue price you paid as provided on the cover of this pricing supplement.\n\nAdditional Risks Related to the Underlying Index\n\n* An Investment in the Offered Notes Is Subject to Risks Associated with Foreign Securities\n\nThe value of your notes is linked to an underlying index that is comprised of stocks from one or more foreign securities markets. Investments linked to the value of foreign equity securities involve particular risks. Any foreign securities market may be less liquid, more volatile and affected by global or domestic market developments in a different way than are the U.S. securities market or other foreign securities markets. Both government intervention in a foreign securities market, either directly or indirectly, and cross-shareholdings in foreign companies, may affect trading prices and volumes in that market. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies than about those U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Further, foreign companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements that differ from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies.\n\nThe prices of securities in a foreign country are subject to political, economic, financial and social factors that are unique to such foreign country's geographical region. These factors include: recent changes, or the possibility of future changes, in the applicable foreign government's economic and fiscal policies; the possible implementation of, or changes in, currency exchange laws or other laws or restrictions applicable to foreign companies or investments in foreign equity securities; fluctuations, or the possibility of fluctuations, in currency exchange rates; and the possibility of outbreaks of hostility, political instability, natural disaster or adverse public health developments. The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the European Union on January 31, 2020 (an event commonly referred to as \"Brexit\"). The effects of Brexit are uncertain, and, among other things, Brexit has contributed, and may continue to contribute, to volatility in the prices of securities of companies located in Europe (or elsewhere) and currency exchange rates, including the valuation of the euro and British pound in particular. Any one of these factors, or the combination of more than one of these factors, could negatively affect such foreign securities market and the price of securities therein. Further, geographical regions may react to global factors in different ways, which may cause the prices of securities in a foreign securities market to fluctuate in a way that differs from those of securities in the\n\nU.S. securities market or other foreign securities markets. Foreign economies may also differ from the U.S. economy in important respects, including growth of gross national product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resources and self-sufficiency, which may have a positive or negative effect on foreign securities prices.\n\n* Government Regulatory Action, Including Legislative Acts and Executive Orders, Could Result in Material Changes to the Composition of an Underlying Index with Underlying Index Stocks from One or More Foreign Securities Markets and Could Negatively Affect Your Investment in the Notes\n\nGovernment regulatory action, including legislative acts and executive orders, could cause material changes to the composition of an underlying index with underlying index stocks from one or more foreign securities markets and could negatively affect your investment in the notes in a variety of ways, depending on the nature of such government regulatory action and the underlying index stocks that are affected. For example, recent executive orders issued by the United States Government prohibit United States persons from purchasing or selling publicly traded securities of certain companies that are determined to operate or have operated in the defense and related materiel sector or the surveillance technology sector of the economy of the People's Republic of China, or publicly traded securities that are derivative of, or that are designed to provide investment exposure to, those securities (including indexed notes). If the prohibitions in those executive orders (or prohibitions under other government regulatory action) become applicable to underlying index stocks that are currently included in an underlying index or that in the future are included in an underlying index, such underlying index stocks may be removed from an underlying index. If government regulatory action results in the removal of underlying index stocks that have (or historically have had) significant weight in an underlying index, such removal could have a material and negative effect on the level of such underlying index and, therefore, your investment in the notes. Similarly, if underlying index stocks that are subject to those executive orders or subject to other government regulatory action are not removed from an underlying index, the value of the notes could be materially and negatively affected, and transactions in, or holdings of, the notes may become prohibited under United States law. Any failure to remove such underlying index stocks from an underlying index could result in the loss of a significant portion or all of your investment in the notes, including if you attempt to divest the notes at a time when the value of the notes has declined.\n\nRisks Related to Tax\n\nAny insurance company or fiduciary of a pension plan or other employee benefit plan that is subject to the prohibited transaction rules of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, which we call \"ERISA\", or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including an IRA or a Keogh plan (or a governmental plan to which similar prohibitions apply), and that is considering purchasing the offered securities with the assets of the insurance company or the assets of such a plan, should consult with its counsel regarding whether the purchase or holding of the offered securities could become a \"prohibited transaction\" under ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or any substantially similar prohibition in light of the representations a purchaser or holder in any of the above categories is deemed to make by purchasing and holding the offered securities. This is discussed in more detail under \"Employee Retirement Income Security Act\" below.\n\nThe tax consequences of an investment in your securities are uncertain, both as to the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of your securities.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service announced on December 7, 2007 that it is considering issuing guidance regarding the tax treatment of an instrument such as your securities, and any such guidance could adversely affect the value and the tax treatment of your securities. Among other things, the Internal Revenue Service may decide to require the holders to accrue ordinary income on a current basis and\n\nrecognize ordinary income on payment at maturity, and could subject non-U.S. investors to withholding tax. Furthermore, in 2007, legislation was introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would have required holders that acquired instruments such as your securities after the bill was enacted to accrue interest income over the term of such instruments even though there will be no interest payments over the term of such instruments. It is not possible to predict whether a similar or identical bill will be enacted in the future, or whether any such bill would affect the tax treatment of your securities. We describe these developments in more detail under \"Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences - United States Holders - Possible Change in Law\" below. You should consult your tax advisor about this matter. Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, GS Finance Corp. intends to continue treating the securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with the treatment described under \"Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\" below unless and until such time as Congress, the Treasury Department or the Internal Revenue Service determine that some other treatment is more appropriate. Please also consult your tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax and any other applicable tax consequences to you of owning your securities in your particular circumstances.\n\nPlease see the discussion under \"United States Taxation -- Taxation of Debt Securities -- Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Withholding\" in the accompanying prospectus for a description of the applicability of FATCA to payments made on your securities.\n\nThe EURO STOXX 50\u00ae Index is a free-float market capitalization-weighted index of 50 European blue-chip stocks. The 50 stocks included in the EURO STOXX 50\u00ae Index are allocated to one of the following Eurozone countries based on their country of incorporation, primary listing and largest trading volume: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.\n\nFor more details about the EURO STOXX 50\u00ae Index, the underlying index sponsor and license agreement between the underlying index sponsor and the issuer, see \"The Underliers -- EURO STOXX 50\u00ae Index\" on page S-36 of the accompanying underlier supplement no. 38.\n\nThe EURO STOXX 50\u00ae is the intellectual property of STOXX Limited, Zurich, Switzerland and/or its licensors (\"Licensors\"), which is used under license. The securities or other financial instruments based on the underlying index are in no way sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by STOXX and its Licensors and neither STOXX nor its Licensors shall have any liability with respect thereto.\n\nHistorical Closing Levels of the Underlying Index\n\nThe closing levels of the underlying index have fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. In particular, the underlying index has recently experienced extreme and unusual volatility. Any historical upward or downward trend in the closing levels of the underlying index during the period shown below is not an indication that the underlying index is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time during the life of your securities.\n\nYou should not take the historical closing levels of the underlying index as an indication of the future performance of the underlying index, including because of the recent volatility described above. We cannot give you any assurance that the future performance of the underlying index or the underlying index stocks will result in you receiving an amount greater than the outstanding face amount of your securities, or that you will not incur a loss on your investment, on the stated maturity date.\n\nNeither we nor any of our affiliates make any representation to you as to the performance of the underlying index. Before investing in the offered securities, you should consult publicly available information to determine the levels of the underlying index between the date of this pricing supplement and the date of your purchase of the offered securities and, given the recent volatility described above, you should pay particular attention to recent levels of the underlying index.\n\nThe actual performance of the underlying index over the life of the offered securities, as well as the cash settlement amount at maturity, may bear little relation to the historical levels shown below.\n\nThe graph below shows the daily historical closing levels of the underlying index from January 1, 2019 through March 15, 2024. As a result, the following graph does not reflect the global financial crisis which began in 2008, which had a materially negative impact on the price of most equity securities and, as a result, the level of most equity indices. We obtained the closing levels in the graph below from Bloomberg Financial Services, without independent verification.\n\nSupplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\n\nThe following section supplements, and to the extent inconsistent, replaces, the discussion of U.S. federal income taxation in the accompanying prospectus.\n\nThe following section is the opinion of Sidley Austin llp, counsel to GS Finance Corp. and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. In addition, it is the opinion of Sidley Austin llp that the characterization of the securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes that will be required under the terms of the securities, as discussed below, is a reasonable interpretation of current law.\n\nThis section does not apply to you if you are a member of a class of holders subject to special rules, such as:\n\nAlthough this section is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations under the Internal Revenue Code, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in effect, no statutory, judicial or administrative authority directly addresses how your securities should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and as a result, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in your securities are uncertain. Moreover, these laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.\n\nYou should consult your tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax and other tax consequences of your investment in the securities, including the application of state, local or other tax laws and the possible effects of changes in federal or other tax laws.\n\nThis section applies to you only if you are a United States holder that holds your securities as a capital asset for tax purposes. You are a United States holder if you are a beneficial owner of a security and you are:\n\nTax Treatment. You will be obligated pursuant to the terms of the securities -- in the absence of a change in law, an administrative determination or a judicial ruling to the contrary -- to characterize your securities for all tax purposes as pre-paid derivative contracts in respect of the underlying index. Except as otherwise stated below, the discussion herein assumes that the securities will be so treated.\n\nUpon the sale, exchange or maturity of your securities, you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash you receive at such time and your tax basis in your securities. Your tax basis in the securities will generally be equal to the amount that you paid for the securities. If you hold your securities for more than one year, the gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss. If you hold your securities for one year or less, the gain or loss generally will be short-term capital gain or loss. Short-term capital gains are generally subject to tax at the marginal tax rates applicable to ordinary income.\n\nNo statutory, judicial or administrative authority directly discusses how your securities should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in the securities are uncertain and alternative characterizations are possible. Accordingly, we urge you to consult your tax advisor in determining the tax consequences of an investment in your securities in your particular circumstances, including the application of state, local or other tax laws and the possible effects of changes in federal or other tax laws.\n\nAlternative Treatments. There is no judicial or administrative authority discussing how your securities should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, the Internal Revenue Service might assert that a treatment other than that described above is more appropriate. For example, the Internal Revenue Service could treat your securities as a single debt instrument subject to special rules governing contingent payment debt instruments. Under those rules, the amount of interest you are required to take into account for each accrual period would be determined by constructing a projected payment schedule for the securities and applying rules similar to those for accruing original issue discount on a hypothetical noncontingent debt instrument with that projected payment schedule. This method is applied by first determining the comparable yield - i.e., the yield at which we would issue a noncontingent fixed rate debt instrument with terms and conditions similar to your securities - and then determining a payment schedule as of the issue date that would produce the comparable yield. These rules may have the effect of requiring you to include interest in income in respect of your securities prior to your receipt of cash attributable to that income.\n\nIf the rules governing contingent payment debt instruments apply, any gain you recognize upon the sale, exchange or maturity of your securities would be treated as ordinary interest income. Any loss you recognize at that time would be ordinary loss to the extent of interest you included as income in the current or previous taxable years in respect of your securities, and, thereafter, capital loss.\n\nIf the rules governing contingent payment debt instruments apply, special rules would apply to a person who purchases securities at a price other than the adjusted issue price as determined for tax purposes.\n\nIt is also possible that your securities could be treated in the manner described above, except that any gain or loss that you recognize at maturity would be treated as ordinary gain or loss. You should consult your tax advisor as to the tax consequences of such characterization and any possible alternative characterizations of your securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nIt is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could seek to characterize your securities in a manner that results in tax consequences to you that are different from those described above. You should consult your tax advisor as to the tax consequences of any possible alternative characterizations of your securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nPossible Change in Law\n\nOn December 7, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service released a notice stating that the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department are actively considering issuing guidance regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of an instrument such as the offered securities, including whether holders should be required to accrue ordinary income on a current basis and whether gain or loss should be ordinary or capital. It is not possible to determine what guidance they will ultimately issue, if any. It is possible, however, that under such guidance, holders of the securities will ultimately be required to accrue income currently and this could be applied on a retroactive basis. The Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department are also considering other relevant issues, including whether foreign holders of such instruments should be subject to withholding tax on any deemed income accruals and whether the special \"constructive ownership rules\" of Section 1260 of the Internal Revenue Code might be applied to such instruments. Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, we intend to continue treating the securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with the treatment described above under \"Tax Treatment\" unless and until such time as Congress, the Treasury Department or the Internal Revenue Service determine that some other treatment is more appropriate.\n\nFurthermore, in 2007, legislation was introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would have required holders that acquired instruments such as your securities after the bill was enacted to accrue interest income over the term of such instruments even though there will be no interest payments over the term of such instruments. It is not possible to predict whether a similar or identical bill will be enacted in the future, or whether any such bill would affect the tax treatment of your securities.\n\nIt is impossible to predict what any such legislation or administrative or regulatory guidance might provide, and whether the effective date of any legislation or guidance will affect securities that were issued before the date that such legislation or guidance is issued. You are urged to consult your tax advisor as to the possibility that any legislative or administrative action may adversely affect the tax treatment of your securities.\n\nThis section applies to you only if you are a non-United States holder. You are a non-United States holder if you are the beneficial owner of securities and are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\nYou will be subject to generally applicable information reporting and backup withholding requirements as discussed in the accompanying prospectus under \"United States Taxation -- Taxation of Debt\n\nSecurities -- Backup Withholding and Information Reporting -- Non-United States Holders\" with respect to payments on your securities at maturity and, notwithstanding that we do not intend to treat the securities as debt for tax purposes, we intend to backup withhold on such payments with respect to your securities unless you comply with the requirements necessary to avoid backup withholding on debt instruments (in which case you will not be subject to such backup withholding) as set forth under \"United States Taxation -- Taxation of Debt Securities -- Non-United States Holders\" in the accompanying prospectus.\n\nAs discussed above, alternative characterizations of the securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes are possible. Should an alternative characterization of the securities, by reason of a change or clarification of the law, by regulation or otherwise, cause payments at maturity with respect to the securities to become subject to withholding tax, we will withhold tax at the applicable statutory rate and we will not make payments of any additional amounts. Prospective non-United States holders of the securities should consult their tax advisors in this regard.\n\nFurthermore, on December 7, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service released Notice 2008-2 soliciting comments from the public on various issues, including whether instruments such as your securities should be subject to withholding. It is therefore possible that rules will be issued in the future, possibly with retroactive effect, that would cause payments on your securities at maturity to be subject to withholding, even if you comply with certification requirements as to your foreign status.\n\nIn addition, the Treasury Department has issued regulations under which amounts paid or deemed paid on certain financial instruments (\"871(m) financial instruments\") that are treated as attributable to U.S.-source dividends could be treated, in whole or in part depending on the circumstances, as a \"dividend equivalent\" payment that is subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable treaty), which in the case of amounts you receive upon the sale, exchange or maturity of your securities, could be collected via withholding. If these regulations were to apply to the securities, we may be required to withhold such taxes if any U.S.-source dividends are paid on the stocks included in the underlying index during the term of the securities. We could also require you to make certifications (e.g., an applicable Internal Revenue Service Form W-8) prior to the maturity of the securities in order to avoid or minimize withholding obligations, and we could withhold accordingly (subject to your potential right to claim a refund from the Internal Revenue Service) if such certifications were not received or were not satisfactory. If withholding was required, we would not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld. These regulations generally will apply to 871(m) financial instruments (or a combination of financial instruments treated as having been entered into in connection with each other) issued (or significantly modified and treated as retired and reissued) on or after January 1, 2025, but will also apply to certain 871(m) financial instruments (or a combination of financial instruments treated as having been entered into in connection with each other) that have a delta (as defined in the applicable Treasury regulations) of one and are issued (or significantly modified and treated as retired and reissued) on or after January 1, 2017. In addition, these regulations will not apply to financial instruments that reference a \"qualified index\" (as defined in the regulations). We have determined that, as of the issue date of your securities, your securities will not be subject to withholding under these rules. In certain limited circumstances, however, you should be aware that it is possible for non-United States holders to be liable for tax under these rules with respect to a combination of transactions treated as having been entered into in connection with each other even when no withholding is required. You should consult your tax advisor concerning these regulations, subsequent official guidance and regarding any other possible alternative characterizations of your securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Withholding\n\nPursuant to Treasury regulations, Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) withholding (as described in \"United States Taxation -- Taxation of Debt Securities -- Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Withholding\" in the accompanying prospectus) will generally apply to obligations that are issued on or after July 1, 2014; therefore, the securities will generally be subject to the FATCA withholding rules.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION; CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nSee \"Supplemental Plan of Distribution\" on page S-51 of the accompanying general terms supplement and \"Plan of Distribution -- Conflicts of Interest\" on page 127 of the accompanying prospectus. GS Finance Corp. estimates that its share of the total offering expenses, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $ .\n\nGS Finance Corp. will sell to Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (\"GS&Co.\"), and GS&Co. will purchase from GS Finance Corp., the aggregate face amount of the offered securities specified on the front cover of this pricing supplement. GS&Co. proposes initially to offer the securities to the public at the original issue price set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement, and to UBS Financial Services Inc. at such price less a concession not in excess of 3.50% of the face amount.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs Group Insiders Sell US$25m Of Stock, Possibly Signalling Caution",
        "body": "In the last year, many The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs Group\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman, for US$5.0m worth of shares, at about US$394 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$387. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Goldman Sachs Group shares. In total, insiders dumped US$14m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs Group\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own about US$628m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold Goldman Sachs Group shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Goldman Sachs Group. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group you should be aware of.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.",

        "body": "More than a year ago, software giant Hexagon announced it was working with Raytheon Technologies to provide a simulation tool that predicts metal 3D printing defects. That solution is now ready to be commercialized. Named the PBF Process and Defect Analysis solution (PDA), that solution is a combination of Simufact Additive's and Raytheon Technologies' Pratt and Whitney business.\n\nThe new feature helps designers and engineers evaluate the print outcome and test combinations of materials, geometries, and print processes without expensive and time-consuming physical test runs.\n\nBy predicting thermal history and defects swiftly, at the individual scan vector and powder layer level - the PBF Process and Defect Analysis solution enables operators to anticipate and mitigate risks associated with local defects, such as keyholing, lack of fusion, balling up, and surface roughness.\n\nJeff Robertson, Hexagon's director of global business development points out which main challenge is tackled by PDA: \"The ability to evaluate full laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) parts on the meso-scale will reduce the effort to achieve part certification and thereby support industrialization of metal 3D printing.\"\n\nPBF Process and Defect Analysis can be incorporated before Simufact Additive's Metal Powder Bed Fusion (MPBF) process simulation, to identify the best process settings to achieve a defect-free part. Subsequently, Simufact Additive's detailed simulation of the MPBF process based on the identified settings can be used to calculate part distortions after both the build and post-build stages. One can then compensate for the distortions on the part and export the compensated part for the physical production, a press release says.\n\nIt's too soon to say it's a trend, but a growing number of defect analysis tools are being developed and commercialized. While they are only compatible with Metal Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) now, these developments are a good sign software providers are going the extra mile to enhance the AM process.",

        "title": "400-HP 2025 Ford Maverick ST Would Be a Great Virtual Idea If Not for the CUV Looks",
        "body": "It's been a minute since we last talked about the popular Ford Maverick unibody compact pickup truck. But it's all coming back to us now because at the New York Auto Show later this month, its only rival, the 2025 Hyundai Santa Cruz, is getting a much-needed refresh. 9 photosPhoto: Digimods DESIGN / YouTube Of course, as with many Blue Ovals, the last time we mentioned a Ford Maverick in our newsreel was due to a recall involving a potential fuel tank open pinch joint and one regarding Maverick Hybrid's instrument cluster software issue. On the other hand, most likely, when the first quarter sales tally comes in, the compact Blue Oval pickup truck will reassert its massive dominance over the only other representative of the sector in the US automotive market - Hyundai's Santa Cruz.\n\nThe latter is getting a much-needed refresh and will premiere at the 2024 New York Auto Show, which kicks off on March 27 with the first press day (March 29-April 7 is general audience access) alongside its facelifted Tucson SUV sibling. Naturally, Ford is going to wait a little to see what's in store with the 2025 Santa Cruz and then will decide if it needs to mitigate the rival equipped with a standard 2.5-liter with 191 hp or an optional 2.5-liter turbo packing 281 horsepower.\n\nSuppose they take a stand against Santa Cruz with a new version of their best-selling Maverick. In that case, someone from across the imaginative realm of digital car content creators has already found an interesting solution - borrow the looks and powertrain from the newly updated 2025 Ford Explorer ST. As such, Dimas Ramadhan, the virtual automotive artist behind the Digimods DESIGN channel on YouTube, has taken up the task of CGI-revealing a feisty Maverick ST compact unibody pickup truck.\n\nBecause everyone's entitled to an opinion and beauty is always in the eye of the beholder, we are first going to give you our thoughts on the matter. For starters, we think a more powerful Maverick than the Maverick hybrid with 191 hp or the Maverick EcoBoost with 250 hp is more than welcome. It would help fight off the 281-hp Santa Cruz even better and enhance its payload and towing capabilities.\n\nHowever, the 3.0-liter twin-turbo EcoBoost V6 with 400 hp from the 2025 Ford Explorer ST and 2025 Lincoln Aviator is slightly overkill. If it fits in the engine bay, it would probably arrive with something along the line of 300 to 350 hp so as not to impact the sales of the 2025 Ranger Raptor, which carries the same 3.0L TT V6 with a rating of 405 horsepower. Also, the design is lacking a lot.\n\nThis unofficial design project brings the updated looks of the 2025 Explorer ST to a potential Maverick ST variant, but we think that it would lessen the appeal of the compact pickup truck - which is extremely popular exactly because it's the opposite of a stylish crossover SUV. What do you think?",

        "title": "The Volkswagen ID. Buzz GTX Is a Spicy Electric Van With 335 HP",
        "body": "Following the launch of the ID.4 GTX and ID.5 GTX in 2021, Volkswagen doubled down on its high-performance EV lineup last week. The ID.3 GTX and ID.7 GTX Tourer are now being closely followed by a sporty electric van from the VW Commercial Vehicles division. Get ready to meet the ID. Buzz GTX, which portrays a more potent iteration of the modern-day Microbus.\n\nThe Euro-bound van for families who are always in a hurry comes standard with all-wheel drive courtesy of dual electric motors. Customers get to pick from a standard-wheelbase version combined with a 79-kWh battery and a longer-wheelbase model benefiting from a higher 86-kWh usable energy content.\n\nThe pair of motors is good for a total system output of 335 horsepower, enabling a sprint to 62 mph in just six and a half seconds for both flavors. Flat out, the VW ID. Buzz GTX will reach an electronically governed 99 mph.\n\nStick to the standard ID. Buzz GTX and you'll be able to tow as much as 3,968 pounds whereas the stretched derivative with the larger battery can haul only 3,527 pounds. VW doesn't specify the combined torque but it does mention the rear-mounted motor is rated at 413 lb-ft while the front motor delivers 99 lb-ft.\n\nThe maximum charging power will depend on the battery since the smaller pack supports 185 kW whereas the upgraded pack can take 200 kW. The base battery takes approximately 25 minutes to charge from 10 to 80 percent whereas the larger one needs less than 30 minutes.\n\nAs with the other GTX models, the high-performance ID. Buzz gets an assortment of styling tweaks with redesigned bumpers, a honeycomb grille, and striking Cherry Red paint. There are also exclusive standard 19-inch wheels offered together with two optional sets of fresh 21-inch alloys. Setting it further apart are those boomerang-shaped lower lights, along with dark accents, a black headliner, and sporty seats.\n\nElsewhere, the family hauler has a slightly larger touchscreen (12.9 inches instead of 12 inches), a new optional head-up display, and illuminated touch sliders for the AC and volume. Go for the long-wheelbase model and VW sells at an extra cost its largest-ever panoramic sunroof that goes from opaque to transparent at the touch of a button.\n\nThe ID. Buzz GTX goes on sale in Europe this summer.\n\nVW will bring the electric van to the United States later this year exclusively with the longer wheelbase, three-row seating, and the 86-kWh battery. American buyers are going to pick from single-motor, rear-wheel-drive and dual-motor, all-wheel-drive configurations. The US-bound model will be imported from Hanover, Germany, so it's unlikely to qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit.",

        "body": "The all-new 2025 Infiniti QX80 reimagines the luxury body-on-frame full-size SUV for its third outing and switches to a contemporary styling, and packs a downsized powertrain that's still more capable than the old-school 5.6-liter V8 it replaces. 64 photosPhoto: Infiniti The design is basically the Infiniti QX80 Monograph Concept translated into series production. It's quite staggering because the flowing lines still don't mask the sheer bulkiness of this massive SUV, and Infiniti did this on purpose - they even called the profile \"anti-wedge.\" This is also the newest evolution of the company's design, so we expect to see its elements translated into other models in the near future.\n\nThe luxury Japanese brand also hopes that its \"expert craftmanship\" will lead to \"supreme\" comfort and an impressive outing in front of the live audience when the QX80 debuts alongside the general public at the 2024 New York International Auto Show. It will go on sale this summer with Pure, Luxe, Sensory, and Autograph trims, the first available also with RWD alongside 4WD, and with a starting MSRP of $82,450.\n\nOf course, the outgoing QX80 is slightly cheaper at a starting quotation of $74,150 compared to $82,450, both excluding the $1,995 destination and handling charge. The new generation is also hitting one major threshold - none of the 2024 QX80 trims surpass $88,450, but the 2025 QX80 surges to $100,645 with the Sensory 4WD and to $110,595 with the Autograph 4WD models. That's a hefty jump, right?\n\nStill, Infiniti believes it will be well worth it. The company has one world-first system called 'Front Wide View,' which projects a 170-degree image across the cockpit's two 14.3-inch screens, essentially allowing the driver to 'see' past parked cars or around corners. The segment-firsts include the Klipsch Reference Premiere Audio, Individual Audio, or the Biometric Cooling function; the brand's all-new systems range from ProPilot Assist 2.1 to a full electronic air suspension for the body-on-frame chassis.\n\nInside the cabin, there are two 14.3-inch 'monolith-style' displays projecting the Invisible Hood View or Infiniti's new InTouch with Google built-in infotainment system. Gadgets are also in abundance, like the remote-controlled rear seat, Infiniti Light Path, or the 64-color Personalized Ambient Light, among others. However, one of the major changes occurred under the hood where the old-school 5.6-liter VK56VD V8 and 7-speed automatic transmission were dropped in favor of a new VR35DDTT 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged engine, rated for 450 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque.\n\nDon't cry about the larger mill, though, as Infiniti has added 50 horsepower and 103 lb-ft versus the outgoing QX80. Also, a nine-speed automatic transmission sends power to the rear or all four wheels \"with a 40% wider gear ratio range, allowing for both responsive acceleration and efficient highway cruising.\" Also, the new (optional) Electronic Air Suspension and Dynamic Digital Suspension have settings that can lower it by up to 2.8 inches to an Easy Access level when parked or raise it by 2.4 inches above the normal ride height for off-road adventures.",

        "body": "KUALA LUMPUR (March 21): The Malaysian Aviation Group (MAG) is bracing for eventualities in case makers Boeing delays their order of 10 Boeing 737-8 max aircraft this year.\n\nIt said they were experiencing shortages in fleets while the aviation industry was picking up, and new destinations to India were added therefore the group said it needed to work closely with the aircraft company to prepare for any eventualities.\n\n\"We're working with Boeing to make sure we're not impacted in any way but having said that we're experiencing delays with Boeing. There are issues to be rectified and Boeing is aware of our position,\" said MAG Group Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer Bryan Foong.\n\n\"We're expecting 10 aircraft and that's the latest position Boeing indicated to us this year. We are not 100 per cent sure they will deliver the 10 but we hope they do as we as a network have been impacted by a lack of aircraft. So we are working with them to find ways to deliver the planes on time,\" he added.\n\nBoeing has said it will have to do more work on about 50 undelivered 737 MAX airplanes, potentially delaying near-term deliveries, after its supplier Spirit AeroSystems discovered two mis-drilled holes on some fuselages.\n\nBoeing confirmed the findings in response to a Reuters query after industry sources said a spacing problem had been discovered in holes drilled on a window frame, but the jetmaker said safety was unaffected and existing 737s could keep flying.\n\nThen on March 15, 2024, it was reported on CBS News that Boeing told lawmakers its planned fix for an engine issue on all 737 Max jets will take up to a year, delaying certification of the 737 Max 7 and Max 10 airliners.\n\nMAG group managing director Datuk Captain Izham Ismail said if delays happen they will extend the leases for the current fleet.\n\n\"But it's an older product, our current fleet. It's not competitive in the marketplace and less economical. If you go back to the extended leases you might not get a competitive rate that we got in 2020 during the restructuring, it'll be a high skyrocketed rate and might not benefit the group,\" he said today during MAG annual report launch.\n\nBefore the hiccup, Malaysia Airlines was planning to operate five international and four domestic routes with the 737-8 from October, including services to Bali, Jakarta and Kathmandu in Indonesia, as well as Manila and Phuket in Thailand. Planned domestic destinations are Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Miri and Penang. - Malay Mail",

The firm has maintained an Underweight rating on the stock. The adjustment follows Micron's recent financial performance, which surpassed expectations due to improved pricing that positively impacted earnings per share (EPS) for the first time in several quarters.\n\nThe analyst from Morgan Stanley acknowledged the strong quarter for Micron, noting that it was better than anticipated. The improved pricing that contributed to the company's earnings was highlighted as a key factor in the strong performance.\n\nDespite the price target increase, the analyst's outlook remains cautious, expecting potential weakness in the second half of the year. However, there is an acknowledgment that the stock is likely to experience upward movement in the near term.\n\nMicron's management team has also been a source of positive surprise, demonstrating continued visibility and enthusiasm about the company's direction. This sentiment from Micron's leadership has been factored into the analyst's perspective on the company's stock.\n\nThe firm's Underweight rating on Micron Technology remains unchanged despite the improved price target. The analyst's commentary suggests that while there are positive elements to Micron's current situation, there is still a cautious stance on the stock's prospects later in the year.\n\nMicron Technology, listed on NASDAQ:MU, is a major player in the semiconductor industry, providing memory and storage solutions. Its financial performance and the outlook provided by management are closely watched by investors and analysts for indications of the company's future performance and the semiconductor industry's overall health.",

        "title": "HCA Healthcare bid to open Candler freestanding ER gets new life from NC Appellate Court",
        "body": "ASHEVILLE - HCA Healthcare's pursuit to open a freestanding emergency department in Candler received new life March 19 after a favorable opinion from the North Carolina Court of Appeals.\n\nThe ruling was the latest chapter of HCA's years-long effort to open the facility. Health care providers in North Carolina must navigate a \"Certificate of Need\" process if they want to expand their facilities, equipment, or initiate certain medical services.\n\nThe state approved HCA's application in May 2022, which AdventHealth appealed to the Office of Administrative Hearings. Administrative Law Judge David Sutton reversed the decision in March 2023 because the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services erred by not holding a public hearing on the facility, which he wrote consequently substantially affected AdventHealth. NCDHHS appealed Sutton's decision shortly after the ruling.\n\nOn March 19, the North Carolina Court of Appeals submitted an opinion declaring that Sutton made a mistake.\n\nAppellate Judges Michael Stading and Jefferson Griffin vacated Sutton's ruling, sending the case back to an administrative law judge court.\n\n\"What AdventHealth is confident of is that the people of Buncombe County want health care choice and competition and we are honored they chose us to meet that need,\" AdventHealth spokesperson Victoria Dunkle said in a March 19 statement to the Citizen Times.\n\nSutton relied on a 2007 case, Hospice at Greensboro, Inc. v. NCDHHS, when the state forwent a CON review process for a provider to open a hospice in Greensboro, keeping competitors from contesting. The court classified that omission as \"substantially prejudicing\" a competing provider.\n\nThe appellate judges said that case did not apply because the state conducted a CON review and AdventHealth filed written comments opposing Mission's proposal. They found that AdventHealth proved that the state failed by not holding a hearing but did not show evidence of how that failure impacted them. The case will continue in the lower court.\n\n\"AdventHealth satisfied its burden of proof in showing Agency error, but it failed to forecast particularized evidence of substantial prejudice. Yet, our determination in this case should not be misconstrued. AdventHealth may ultimately satisfy its burden; it may not,\" Griffin and Stading wrote.\n\n\"While this Court may address summary judgment on alternative grounds de novo, we deem this case an appropriate circumstance to remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\"\n\nAn appellate court can hear a case \"de novo\" by referring to the lower court's record to determine the facts, but can rule on the law without referencing the lower court's findings, according to Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Patients continue to choose Mission Hospital for emergency care, and we were proactive in solving this rise in ER demand by pursuing two Certificate of Need approvals for two additional ERs in spring of 2022. These ERs are solutions to help meet the needs of our community and bring quicker access to emergency care to South and West Asheville,\" Mission Health spokesperson Nancy Lindell told the Citizen Times in a March 19 statement.\n\nThis is one of three HCA freestanding emergency department applications. NCDHHS granted HCA a CON for a West Asheville facility Sept. 25, which is for the same freestanding emergency department over which the court of appeals recently opined. This time, the state held a public hearing. AdventHealth appealed the certification a month later.\n\nSutton also reversed the state's decision to grant HCA certification for an Arden freestanding emergency department because NCDHHS also failed to hold a public hearing. That case is currently in front of the court of appeals.\n\nEmergency services at HCA-owned Mission Hospital have been a source of criticism from news reports, state and federal regulators.\n\nIn December, NCDHHS found that conditions at Mission Hospital created an immediate jeopardy situation, meaning the hospital's noncompliance with federal Medicare regulations put patients in danger of serious injury, harm or death. The federal government officially declared the immediate jeopardy situation in February. A report detailing the incidents that led to the declaration found that four patients who endured care that did not meet federal emergency services guidelines ultimately died. Regulators said the hyper-dangerous conditions were removed, but the hospital remains out of compliance with federal regulations.\n\nAlso in December, Democratic nominee for governor and North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein sued HCA for failing to provide the level of emergency and oncology services it agreed to after purchasing the Mission Health system in 2019.\n\nLast summer, the Citizen Times reported that patients arriving at Mission Hospital in ambulances endured extended delays to receive hospital care, which created consequential delays for Western North Carolina emergency service systems. Hospital workers and local emergency services leaders attributed the patient safety issue to an overtaxed and understaffed emergency department.\n\nThree counties, including Buncombe, made changes to their patient transport and drop-off policies following the report. HCA has since made improvements to its ambulance patient intake policy, according to its plan to correct deficiencies submitted to the federal government and emergency service leaders.\n\nMore: Mission Hospital violated emergency treatment regulations law, Federal government says\n\nMore: CMS: Mission still not compliant with federal regulations, at risk of losing funding\n\nMore: CMS: Mission Hospital removed 'Immediate Jeopardy' conditions; follow-up results pending\n\nMitchell Black covers Buncombe County and health care for the Citizen Times.

        "title": "US Fed meeting outcome: What's in store for Dow Jones, Nifty 50, gold and the dollar?",
        "body": "Equity markets across the world have surged after the US Federal Reserve meeting outcome on Wednesday and the dollar index has taken a beating. The US Fed on Wednesday kept the interest rates unchanged at 5.25-5.5 per cent. The central bank also made no change in its rate cut forecast for 2024. The median Federal fund rate forecast for 2024 was left unchanged at 4.6 per cent. That leaves the door open for three rate cuts this year.\n\nThe Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, in his speech, said that the interest rates are at the peak of their cycle. He also added that if the economic outlook goes as projected, then the interest rates could be cut later this year.\n\nInflation: Not a worry\n\nPowell acknowledged the recent rise in inflation but said that it has not dented the confidence that the inflation path is heading down towards 2 per cent. The US Headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data has been showing an uptick (month-on-month basis) over the last couple of months. The Fed Chairman indicated that there are chances for the inflation to remain high in the first half and then soften in the second half of the year. However, Powell said that the incoming data on inflation and its context will be important to watch to increase their confidence.\n\nThe Fed has revised its forecast for the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) higher to 2.6 per cent in 2024 from its earlier projection of 2.4 per cent. PCE is the inflation gauge of the Fed.\n\nNo recession\n\nOn the economic growth front, the Fed expects the US to expand at a much better pace than earlier. The central bank projects the US to grow at 2.1 per cent in 2024. This is much higher than the growth forecast of 1.4 per cent made in December. The economic growth is projected to be at 2 per cent for both 2025 and 2026. The growth projection indicates that the Fed is not anticipating the US to run into a recession.\n\nEquities outlook\n\nNo change in the rate cut forecast, better growth outlook has triggered a strong rise in the global equities. The Dow Jones (39,512) has surged well above the key resistance level of 39,200. The outlook is bullish. The index can test 39,700-39,800 in the near-term. A break above 39,800 can take the Dow Jones up to 40,400 in the coming weeks.\n\nNifty 50: Be cautious\n\nOn the domestic front, Nifty50 has come down from an intraday high of 22,081. It is important for the Nifty to get a sustained break above 22,000 and then a subsequent rise past 22,250. Failure to rise above 22,250 in the next few days can keep the index under pressure for a fall to 21,500. So, a cautious approach is needed going forward on the Nifty\n\nGold glitters\n\nGold surged to a record high of $2,222 per ounce on the COMEX. It is currently trading at $2,208 per ounce. The broader picture is looking bullish with strong support at $2,100. Gold can surge to $2,300 and higher in the coming weeks.\n\nWeak dollar\n\nThe dollar index (103.20) has come down sharply from around 104.15. It can break 103 and test the next support level of 102.50 in the near-term. A further break below 102.50 can drag the index down to 101 in the coming weeks.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on March 21, 2024",

        "title": "Dow Jones Hits Record High On Fed Rate Outlook, 5 Stocks In Buy Areas; Micron Soars Late",
        "body": "Dow Jones futures rose modestly overnight, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, following a positive market reaction to a steady Fed rate-cut outlook. Micron Technology (MU) soared overnight on earnings with a Microsoft AI event on tap Thursday.\n\nX\n\nThe stock market rally saw solid gains Wednesday, almost all in the afternoon as Federal Reserve policymakers indicated they still see three rate cuts in 2024. Fed Chief Jerome Powell once again said it's appropriate to start easing \"at some point this year.\"\n\nThe Nasdaq and small caps led while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones hit record highs.\n\nDraftKings stock is on IBD Leaderboard. DraftKings and PVH stock are on SwingTrader. Microsoft stock is on IBD Long-Term Leaders. Microsoft, DraftKings, Arista Networks, JFrog and Royal Caribbean stock are on the IBD 50. Nvidia, Arista Networks and SMCI stock are on the IBD Big Cap 20. PVH was Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day.\n\nDow Jones Futures Today\n\nDow Jones futures were 0.25% above fair value, with Apple stock as slight drag. S&P 500 futures rose 0.3%. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.6%. Micron stock is an S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 component.\n\nRemember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.\n\nMicron Earnings\n\nAfter the close, Micron reported a surprise fiscal second-quarter profit with revenue also topping. The memory-chip giant also gave bullish Q3 guidance. MU stock soared 18% overnight, signaling a record high. Shares rose 2.4% to 96.25 in Wednesday's session.\n\nFed Rate-Hike Outlook\n\nAs expected, the Fed took no action Wednesday afternoon. But policymakers, via their \"dot plot\" projections, see a median year-end fed funds rate of 4.6%, down from the current 5.25%-5.5%. That's unchanged from the late 2023 forecast of three quarter-point Fed rate cuts this year. There had been some speculation that the Fed could curb its plans to just two rate cuts amid sticky inflation.\n\nThe Fed did raise its 2024 GDP and core PCE inflation estimates slightly.\n\nPolicymakers also now see the Fed funds rate at 3.9% at the end of 2025 vs. the December projection of 3.6%, indicating one fewer rate cut.\n\nFed chief Powell said the central bank is making good progress in fighting inflation. He said rate cuts should start \"at some point\" in 2024, but gave few specifics. Powell also said there were no discussions about the balance sheet, indicating policymakers aren't ready to scale back quantitative tightening quite yet.\n\nNotably, Powell seemed unconcerned with the stock market rally and generally easy financial conditions.\n\nThe odds of a June rate cut rose to 75% vs. 59.2% on Tuesday.\n\nThe central bank appears willing to take a wait-and-see approach on rate cuts. There are still several key inflation and economic reports before the June 11-12 meeting.\n\nJoin IBD experts as they analyze leading stocks and the market on IBD Live\n\nStock Market Rally\n\nThe stock market rally gained momentum into the close as the Federal Reserve stayed the course on rate-cut plans and Fed chief Powell didn't say anything to undercut that.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average popped 1% in Wednesday's stock market trading while the S&P 500 index gained 0.9%, both setting all-time highs. The Nasdaq composite advanced 1.25% to a record close. The small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 1.9%, back above the 21-day line and near 23-month highs.\n\nFinancial markets often have a day two reaction to Fed meetings that reverse course.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the market rallied, with a number of stocks flashing buy signals as well as other leaders rebounding and setting up.\n\nThe window of opportunity may not last long. The S&P 500 is 4.6% above its 50-day moving average, not far from the 5% level that would seem extended. The Nasdaq has a little more room at 4.2% above its 50-day.\n\nAmong growth ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) rose 1%, with Microsoft stock a major holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) gained 1.6%. Micron stock is a big SMH holding.\n\nArista stock rose 3.4% to 296.58, clearing a 292.66 flat-base buy point. On Tuesday, shares tumbled to their 10-week line soon after the open, but slashed losses. The relative strength line hit a new high on the breakout, a bullish sign marked by a blue dot at the end of the RS line on a MarketSurge chart.\n\nDraftKings stock jumped 5.7% to 46.27, clearing a short consolidation that wasn't quite long enough to be a flat base. Earlier Wednesday, shares topped a short trendline. DKNG stock has rebounded from the 21-day and 10-week lines this week as March Madness gets underway, fueling sports betting.\n\nPVH stock popped 3.7% to 137.40, rebounding from the 21-day line and breaking a short downtrend. That extended Tuesday's bounce from the 10-week line modestly above a prior consolidation.\n\nJFrog stock gained 3.9% to 44.65, bouncing from the 21-day line and breaking a downward-sloping trendline. Volume was below average. FROG stock is in an emerging consolidation following an earnings gap-up on Feb. 15.\n\nRoyal Caribbean stock rallied 4.7% to 135.53, clearing a 133.77 cup-base buy point. That came hours before RCL stock would have completed a handle, though that would have only lowered the entry by a fraction.\n\nMicrosoft stock edged up 0.9% to 425.23, just making a record close a penny above its March 14 close at 425.22. Shares flashed a buy signal on March 13 as they cleared a not-quite flat base.\n\nThe Dow giant will hold its \"New Era of Work\" event on Thursday. Microsoft will discuss AI innovations, along with what's new with Windows and Surface computers.\n\nWhat To Do Now\n\nThe stock market rally made a bullish move following the Fed meeting and Powell's comments. The major indexes are at or near highs while a number of leading stocks flashed buy signals.\n\nThat offered opportunities for investors to add some exposure. There could be more opportunities on Thursday, assuming the market doesn't have second thoughts.\n\nBut with this week's gains pushing the S&P 500 close to extended and bullish sentiment high, investors might want to add exposure incrementally, especially after Wednesday.\n\nBut look for those stocks that are actionable or setting up. Have your watchlists up to date.\n\nRead The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today",

        "body": "Shipping tycoon Angela Chao was intoxicated at the time she drowned reversing her Tesla into a pond last month at a Texas ranch, according to police.\n\nLaw enforcement found that her blood alcohol level was nearly three times the state's legal limit when the incident happened.\n\nBlanco County Sheriff's Office had initially declined to share many details around the death, which was first reported last month, stating they were still investigating.\n\nBut newly-released police records reveal that Chao was drunk at the time she reversed her Tesla Model X SUV into a pond in an estate on 10 February in Blanco County, outside Austin.\n\nChao was the sister-in-law of former Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell and married to venture capitalist Jim Breyer. She was chair and chief executive of her family's shipping business, the Foremost Group, and the president of her father's philanthropic organisation, the Foremost Foundation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Blanco County Sheriff's Office made public 62 pages of records concerning Chao's death. The documents described the incident as an \"unfortunate accident\" and revealed that her blood-alcohol level was 0.233 grams per 100 millilitres - approximately three times the legal driving limit of 0.08 grams per 100 millilitres.\n\nChao, 50, intended to drive from one building to another on the ranch due to the cold weather, police said. However, shortly after she entered her car, she mistakenly put the vehicle in reverse and ended up backing into a pond, according to police reports.\n\nAccording to a report by Business Insider, a number of Tesla owners had earlier communicated to federal authorities their experiences of confusion and potentially hazardous scenarios over the unconventional gear-shifting mechanisms in their vehicles.\n\nBut Chao's family did not blame Tesla for the death.\n\n\"Angela's passing was a terrible tragedy, and words cannot describe the family's profound grief,\" a spokesman for her father James SC Chao and the wider family said in an emailed statement. \"The family is grateful for the first responders and friends who tried so hard to save her.\"",

        "title": "Man in crash that killed lawyer searched 'how to delete Tesla recordings'",
        "body": "An Auckland man who lost control of his Tesla in a crash that killed a young lawyer used his phone to search how to delete the car's travel data before calling 111 for help.\n\nIn the moments after the crash, nearby residents scrambled to the scene to find driver Saurbh Sharma, 26, still in the upside-down vehicle that had landed in a hedge with power lines splayed around it. The vehicle began smoking and Sharma managed to crawl through a hole in the side of the car before it erupted into flames.\n\nSharma's passenger and friend, Auckland barrister Shubham Kaur, known as Khushi, died in the January 4, 2022 crash in Taupiri and he was later charged with careless driving causing her death.\n\nHe is now defending that charge.\n\nThe first two days of the judge-alone trial were heard in the Huntly District Court last month and the trial resumed in the Hamilton District Court today before Judge Glen Marshall.\n\nDetective Constable Harjot Sandhu testified how he extracted the data from Sharma's phone and found messages he made in the months leading up to the crash and the moments straight after it.\n\nHe discovered Sharma first used the phone to search \"how to delete Tesla recordings\". A Tesla vehicle automatically, and regularly, uploads its travel data to the cloud.\n\nAuckland lawyer Shubham Kaur was killed in the crash. Photo / Supplied\n\nThirty-four seconds after searching for data about Tesla Sharma called 111, but it wasn't answered.\n\nHe then called his friend Divesh Goundar before calling his policeman brother-in-law, Jagmohan Singh, who was based in Auckland at the time.\n\nThey talked for 43 seconds.\n\nSandhu also analysed some of Sharma's texts he'd made in the months leading up to the crash.\n\nIn a text exchange about the vehicle's auto-drive feature, Sharma says \"auto-drive saves life\" adding in laughing emojis.\n\nTexting another friend who asks how the Tesla is going, Sharma replies, \"I have been such a rough driver ever since I have got my hands on the Tesla\".\n\nHe texts again saying, \"It's one dangerous car and a family type at the same time\".\n\nKaur texted him at 1.52am on November 18, 2021 asking if he got home, and he replies, \"hahaha nearly f***** up\", before replying again, \"was speeding for a bit, bro. That Fast and Furious shit\".\n\nSaurbh Sharma of Auckland pictured outside the Huntly District Court last month. He is defending a charge of careless driving causing the death of Shubham Kaur, a barrister from Auckland, on Dawson Rd in Taupiri in January 2022. Photo / Belinda Feek\n\nKaur replied, \"wtf\".\n\nIt was then Sandhu decided to call Sharma in for a formal interview.\n\nIn the DVD interview played to the court Sharma explained how it was a \"normal drive, everything was happy and amazing and all of a sudden I drove over a bit of this hump\".\n\n\"That's where I lost control of the car and I crashed,\" adding that he slammed on the brakes when he felt the bottom of the car scrape on the road.\n\nThe next thing he saw were live wires around his car.\n\nHe then described a muddled series of events, in which the interview is stopped several times to give him a break.\n\nSharma first described crawling out of a gap in the car before dragging Kaur out \"because that was a priority\".\n\nWhen questioned again, he said, \"I was yelling for her and she was not responding so I started dragging her\".\n\nWhen pressed again by the detective, Sharma contended that he remembered unbuckling her and then she fell on top of him.\n\n\"That's when I dragged her out.\"\n\nHowever, police witnesses described during the earlier hearing how Kaur's remains were eventually discovered underneath the upturned and charred Tesla.\n\nEarlier Sharma explained how he met Kaur at a friend's birthday about three years ago, however they became closer after his relationship break-up in May 2021.\n\n\"She's just a really good friend of mine. I honestly call her my travelling buddy . . . [it's] just a common interest between us.",

        "body": "Chao, the former CEO of dry bulk shipping giant Foremost Group, had planned to celebrate the weekend with her girlfriends but the night ended in tragedy.\n\nAngela Chao, the billionaire sister-in-law of Senator Mitch McConnell, was reportedly drunk when she unintentionally backed her Tesla into a pond on a Texas ranch and died last month, according to police. The investigation conducted by the sheriff's office determined that Chao's death on February 10 was deemed \"an unfortunate accident.\"\n\nThe Blanco County Sheriff's Office released a report on Wednesday revealing that Chao's blood alcohol level was nearly three times the state's legal limit when she backed her car into the pond while attempting a three-point turn. The incident took place while Chao was with seven of her girlfriends at a sprawling 4,500-acre private property in Texas' Hill Country.\n\nUnfortunate Death While Being Drunk\n\nChao, the former CEO of dry bulk shipping giant Foremost Group, had planned to celebrate the weekend with her girlfriends but the night ended in tragedy. The sister-in-law of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was pronounced dead at the scene after her Tesla SUV was retrieved from the water on her 900-acre ranch in Texas on February 11.\n\nAfter having dinner at the property's guest house, the 50-year-old decided to make the short drive to her lodgings on the property in her Tesla Model X SUV at around 11:37 p.m.\n\nAccording to the report, video footage showed her \"walking unsteadily to her vehicle.\"\n\nShortly afterward, she frantically called her friends in a state of panic after inadvertently backing over an embankment and sinking her vehicle into a pond located just yards away from the guest house.\n\nThe report from the Blanco County Sheriff's Office details their frantic efforts to rescue her as she spoke to one of her friends, Amber Keinan, over the phone from her slowly sinking vehicle.\n\n\"Chao told Keinan the water was rising and she was going to die and said \"I love you\" to Keinan prior to the vehicle going under water,\" police said in the report.\n\nPolice said that other friends made desperate attempts to swim to the car to offer assistance, while Keinan paddled out in a kayak to aid in the rescue efforts.\n\nAround 11:55 p.m., someone placed a call to 911 and remained on the line with police for roughly 11 minutes, as detailed in the report.\n\nPolice arrived at the scene and tried to free Chao from the vehicle, which was roughly 25 yards away from the shoreline, amid the screams of Chao's friends, according to police accounts.\n\nThey managed to break open the driver's side window, and a deputy reached out and grabbed Chao's hand.\n\nEmergency crews pulled her out of the car and brought her to the shore, where she was pronounced dead at 1:40 a.m. on February 11.\n\nHeavily Drunk\n\nAt the time of her death, Chao had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.233 grams per 100 milliliters, nearly three times Texas' legal limit of .08, according to the police report.\n\nThe ranch where Chao died is owned by a corporation linked to her husband, Jim Breyer, a venture capitalist and part-owner of the Boston Celtics with an estimated net worth of $2.9 billion, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nChao's sister, Elaine Chao, is married to McConnell and has served as Secretary of Labor under President George W. Bush and Secretary of Transportation in President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nThe Chao family holds a unique distinction as the only family in the school's history to have four daughters attend Harvard Business School.\n\nChao completed her bachelor's degree in economics with summa cum laude honors in just three years.\n\nFollowing this, she pursued further education at Harvard Business School and later joined her father's company, The Foremost Group, in 1996. Chao was known for her \"pioneering leadership\" and noted as a \"formidable executive\" in the shipping industry.\n\nIn 2018, she assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer of the company. Additionally, Chao was appointed as an independent director on the board of the Bank of China in June 2016.\n\nIn a family statement shortly after her death, Chao's father, James S.C. Chao, said, \"Angela's name in Chinese sounds like the characters for peace and prosperity.\"\n\nHe added, \"Her absence leaves a void not only in our hearts, but in the Asian-American community,\" as reported by the Associated Press.\n\nTop of Form\n\nChao served as a founding advisory council co-chair of The Asian American Foundation. The organization issued a statement expressing grief over the news of her tragic death.\n\nThe nonprofit said, \"The Asian American Foundation is heartbroken to learn of the devastating death of Angela Chao, a beloved businesswoman, philanthropist and respected leader.\n\n\"Angela has left an indelible mark on The Asian American Foundation and the AAPI community.\n\n\"A brilliant and committed leader, Angela's warmth, kindness, and infectious energy will live on in our work for decades to come.\"",

The NBA legend tries to corral the bird, but he ends up doing more damage than good. He hits his head on the ceiling boards and ends up falling through the flooring.\n\nThe commercial ends with Bird's legs dangling from the ceiling, showcasing the damage done by his enemy. Winters utters the famous line, \"You can save money and be protected from mayhem like me\" and chuckles as he heads down the stairs.\n\nPRINTABLE: Download a 2024 March Madness bracket here\n\nAllstate's latest promotion gives fans a chuckle, and it's also a play on the former Celtics star's name.

Nexstar's WJW reports that a location in Wooster, Ohio, has already shuttered.\n\nWhile some stores will close, others could get a face-lift. CEO Corie Sue Barry said that not every store will be remodeled, but changes will include bringing \"excitement\" and \"relevancy\" to the center of the store area.\n\n\"And so the goal here is not that every single store is going to look like an experience store. The goal though is that every single one has a bit of a refreshed look and feel, has more of those vendor partnership opportunities and has a better ability for our associates to merchandise in a way that makes everything feel kind of full and exciting,\" she added.\n\nBarry also said Best Buy plans to open a few outlet centers and small-format stores where the company has either never had a presence or closed a large-format store.\n\nThis announcement comes as the retailer world faces various other shake-ups.\n\nTarget recently rolled out restrictions on its self-checkouts, and some Walmart customers claim their stores have limited access to self-checkouts to Walmart+ members and Spark delivery drivers only. Costco has cracked down on non-members yet again, making their food courts accessible to cardholders only.\n\nMeanwhile, other retailers have also announced plans to close some of their brick-and-mortar locations. Dollar Tree, Inc., which owns Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, said it will close about 1,000 stores nationwide to improve profitability. Macy's will shutter 150 stores amid losses and declining sales, and The Body Shop is closing down all U.S. operations as it files for bankruptcy.",

        "title": "Entropic Communications, LLC v. Charter Communications, Inc.",
        "body": "When patent holders use public courts to try to enforce their rights, they do not get to fully shut out the public from those disputes. EFF has repeatedly intervened in patent litigation seeking to vindicate the public's presumptive rights to access court proceedings and records in patent disputes, particularly those filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. In March 2024, we went back to this district court and moved to unseal records in Entropic Communications, LLC v. Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute between a semiconductor products provider, Entropic, and one of the nation's largest media companies, Charter, which offers cable television and internet service to millions of people. Entropic alleged that Charter infringed its patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,223,775, 8,284,690, 8,792,008, 9,210,362, 9,825,826, and 10,135,682), which cover cable modem technology. A key issue in the case appears to be the relevance of the industry-leading Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) cable data transmission standard. This standard is a cornerstone of cable internet in the United States, making it unusually important. In addition, Charter's license defense based on DOCSIS may implicate a core legal question in patent law: when is a particular patent \"essential\" to a technical standard and thus encumbered by licensing commitments?\n\nOn September 11, 2023, Entropic moved for summary judgment of no license defense based on the DOCSIS. The public version of Entropic's motion is heavily redacted, making it hard to understand. Entropic never moved to seal its motion, and thus did not provide any justification for sealing. Every associated exhibit remains sealed.\n\nFrom September to October 2023, Charter and Entropic filed briefs under seal without a motion to seal and without further elaboration. They filed heavily redacted public versions of each filing, making it difficult for the public to understand Charter's asserted defense and Entropic's arguments against it. Even a portion of a table of contents is redacted. Some exhibit names are, too.\n\nIn November 2023, Magistrate Judge Roy Payne issued a Report and Recommendation (R&R), which explained Charter's DOCSIS defense for the first time and denied Entropic's motion in part and granted it in part. What little the public can now glean about the DOCSIS dispute is through the limited information Judge Payne revealed in his R&R, which was entirely unredacted. In the R&R, the public learned for the first time that the two key issues are (1) what the DOCSIS License means by \"Licensed Technology\" as a matter of contract interpretation and (2) whether Charter has plausibly shown any of the patents at issue fall within the meaning of \"Licensed Technology.\"\n\nAfter EFF notified the parties of the many documents they had improperly filed under seal, they refused to make those records public. EFF's motion asks the court to order the parties to unseal material that it cannot justify keeping secret and to closely scrutinize any claims of secrecy made by the parties to make sure they are not broadly restricting access to court records.",

        "title": "Sysco Corporation: Robust Volume Growth (NYSE:SYY)",
        "body": "Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) is a Food Service business that has lagged the overall market over the past year. But I believe most of the upside is in front of the company with improving volume trends and margins that have recovered since COVID-19. The company also sports a reliable dividend yield of 2.6% with a payout ratio of 47%. SYY posted results on the 30th January and the price jumped 7.5%, where it has stayed trading at around $80. My valuation has SYY up 19% from today's price.\n\nSYY engages in the international selling of various foods primarily to the foodservice industry. The majority of revenues are generated from canned & dry foods, fresh and frozen meats, and frozen fruits and vegetables. They sell mainly to restaurants which generated 62% of revenues in 2023.\n\nSince 2015 the industry has grown at a 3.75% CAGR and SYY holds approximately 17% of the market. They have achieved this industry-leading position through a strategy known as Recipe for Growth. The goal of the strategy is to grow meaningfully faster than the market by prioritizing digital execution, focused marketing, and fostering a good work environment.\n\nWhere their real strengths lie is in their extensive 334 distribution network that covers 6 territories and is claimed to be over double their nearest competitor.\n\nSYY is the largest player in the Food Distributors industry by market share, with trailing revenues of $77 billion. The company also has a reasonably good 5-year CAGR of 5.38%, which is strong taking into context how much market share they own. With that level of growth and a dividend yield north of 2%, excluding everything else, my first thoughts are that this company should be trading at a P/FCF multiple of around 25x. The 10-year P/FCF multiple median is 23x, and it is currently trading at a substantial discount of 16x.\n\nRelative to the sector, profitability is not that strong with trailing EBIT Margins coming in at 3.6% which is -60% below the sector. However, the Food Service industry is a lower margin industry, and when comparing SYY to that, the numbers are much more encouraging. The company ranks as the top performer across EBIT Margins in the industry with ROE levels well in excess of their nearest rival. This is due to the high levels of profitability and the company's optimal capital structure.\n\nAs you can see from the chart below, margins crashed during the pandemic as shutdowns adversely affected volumes, which resulted in a -12% contraction in sales. As volumes returned, margins have since recovered but are still below 2019 levels. I believe there is still room for more margin expansion, especially with the improvements in the company's supply chain.\n\nNet Debt to Sales stands at 13.4% with a cash balance of $1 billion. The next principal repayment is in 2025 of $377 million, and then after, there are payments of $750 million and $1 billion in 2026 and 2027. The company produces over $1.5 billion in Free Cash Flow so is in a fine position to service these debt repayments.\n\nSYY is confident that the momentum they've gained in the first half of the year will persist into the second half. This momentum will be fueled by ongoing robust volume growth as the company remains committed to executing its Recipe for Growth strategy. The first half delivered significant growth primarily attributed to volume gains, with SYY achieving a 3.1% increase in sales, propelled by a 2.5% volume growth across US Food Service. Adjusted EBIT Margins saw an improvement of 25 basis points to 4.1% after factoring in costs.\n\nFrom my perspective, the company is taking proactive steps to expand its market share. To accomplish this, SYY has augmented its sales force by adding more personnel and anticipates further hiring in the latter half of the year. Additionally, they have recently revamped their compensation structure to better incentivize employees and foster a culture of mutual success within their sales force.\n\nAn enhanced supply chain has maximized operating leverage, leading to a notable 11% enhancement in EPS. Following the robust performance in the first half, the company has decided to bolster its capital allocation. They are ramping up share repurchases from $750 million to $1.25 billion in 2024, aiming for total shareholder returns, inclusive of dividends, to reach $2.25 billion.\n\nThe outlook appears promising. Looking ahead to 2024, net sales are projected to increase in the mid-single digits, while adjusted EPS is anticipated to grow by 7%. Although revenue growth aligns with the 5-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR), it is particularly impressive given the strong results achieved in previous years.\n\nWhen valuing SYY I have used a P/FCF multiple of 20x to get a share price target of $95 and an upside of 19% from today's price. Although it looks like margins will expand further going forward as the company keeps improving their supply chain. I have been conservative in extrapolating 14% EBIT Margins out to 2028. This means no margin progress over the next 5 years which feels unlikely, but makes the point of how undervalued this company is.\n\nWorking Capital as a percent of sales has trended down falling -340 basis points since the highs of 2012, I kept this at 2% to 2028, as I believe working capital intensity has reached a floor and won't descend much further. Finally, CAPEX as a percent of sales has reduced over the years and especially recently, due to the robust growth in sales, so I have CAPEX intensity falling slightly below the trend up to 2028.\n\nThe primary challenge to my thesis arises if volumes experience a downturn. Volume levels decreased during the pandemic, followed by a robust recovery throughout 2021. However, in 2023, volumes declined for two consecutive quarters before rebounding in December. The risk lies in the possibility of volume contraction. Should such a scenario materialize, I would reassess my outlook on the company.\n\nSYY is the dominant player in the Food Distribution industry. Forward guidance has sales growing above the 5-year CAGR and this is being driven by robust volume growth. The company has committed to increasing share buybacks, which I think underscores that management believes the shares are undervalued. Also, SYY is confident the strong first half results will continue into the second, so I have initiated a Buy recommendation on the company with a price target of $96.",

        "body": "A digital rendering of Merck Life Science's Bioprocessing Production Center in Daejeon (Merck Life Science)\n\nGerman pharmaceutical group Merck Life Science said Thursday the company will invest around 300 million euros ($326 million) to build a new bioprocessing complex in South Korea, its largest investment yet in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe new investment comes as the company renews its commitment to expanding its production capacities for biotech products in the fast-growing market. It also aims to boost the overall biotech industry in the region, saying the new facility alone will create some 300 new jobs by 2028.\n\nThe upcoming Bioprocessing Production Center will be located on a 43,000-square-meter site in Daejeon. It will be equipped with advanced production facilities, a distribution center and an automated warehouse.\n\nMerck said the facility will support biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the process development, clinical research and commercial manufacturing of biologics. Biologics are derived from large and complex biological compounds and include products like vaccines, cell and gene therapies, or protein-based therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies. They are one of the fastest-growing class of drugs.\n\nThe center will provide essential biotech products such as dry powder cell culture media, process liquids, pre-GMP small-scale manufacturing and sterile sampling systems.\n\nThe new facility is set to be completed by early 2026, with plans to start operation the same year.\n\n\"The Asia-Pacific region is home to a large number of institutions that conduct leading-edge and innovative research, manufacturing and services in areas such as biotechnology, mRNA and gene therapy,\" said Matthias Heinzel, member of the executive board and Merck Life Science CEO.\n\n\"Expanding our presence in the region will bring us even closer to our customers in this evolving and dynamic market. Our goal is to foster deep collaboration to increase the speed in bringing new therapies to patients.\"\n\nThe company added that it will also team up with the Daejeon government to support biotech companies based in the Daedeok Research Complex in the city, as well as expand cooperation with Korean universities.\n\nIn May last year, Merck signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and the Daejeon government to build the new facility. The Korean government also had high hopes for the agreement as it still relies heavily on raw and subsidiary materials for biopharmaceutical drugs.\n\n\"Daejeon is home to many competitive biotech companies and their talented researchers. Together with Merck, we expect to build a new value chain for biotech firms here,\" said Dajeon Mayor Lee Jang-woo.\n\nMeanwhile, Kolon Global will be responsible for the construction of the new facility. According to a regulatory filing on Tuesday, the contract between Merck Life Science and Kolon Global is worth 176.6 billion won ($132 millio",

        "body": "US crude oil production growth in 2024 will likely drop to about 300,000-400,000 b/d in 2024, down from around 1 million b/d in 2023, a top industry veteran said March 19, even as the number of drilling rigs remain at fairly low levels.\n\nConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance said at the CERAWeek by S&P Global conference that he had predicted less production growth last year of about 800,000 b/d, but many industry-watchers had expected fewer volumes.\n\nCurrent US production is about 13.3 million b/d, according to the US Energy Information Administration and in March 2023 it averaged 12.2 million b/d.\n\nFor 2024, S&P Global Commodity Insights forecasts about 625,000 b/d of crude oil growth.\n\nIn any case, the large, unanticipated growth in 2023 is \"starting to moderate,\" Lance said.\n\n\"Probably later this decade we'll see US production plateau and will probably stay there a long time,\" he said. \"I don't know that we'll get to 15 [million b/d], but I think we'll pass through 14 million [b/d] on the way to 15 million [b/d].\"\n\nLance did not attribute a motive for the more moderate crude growth, but US rig counts have fallen sharply over the past year.\n\nThe number of rigs working in US oil and gas fields totaled 660 for the week ended March 14, according to S&P Global analysts, down from around 700 in late October 2023 and 867 at the start of 2023 - a drop of more than 30% in a little over 14 months.\n\nHowever, production rose because more efficient operations have improved well and basin productivity: For example, improved well completions, longer horizontal well legs known as laterals, and Simul-frac - completing two wells at the same time - have all lowered the cost of wells while at the same time reducing the amount of required equipment.\n\nOvintiv recently introduced the first \"Trimul-frac\" well into industry - completing three wells at the same time.\n\nStill, more sophisticated rigs and equipment mean the cost to upstream operators has not dropped much in the past year. Leading-edge day rates for a top-tier rig remain around $35,000, down from around $40,000 in late 2022.\n\nLance said the role of natural gas is still underestimated. While gas prices have dropped below $2/MMBtu from over $3/MMBtu in late 2023, natural gas as a bridge fuel to the energy transition needs to be given more attention, he said.\n\n\"Where is this power [for greater electrification for the energy transition] going to come from?\" Lance said. \"Data centers are required 24/7 and 365 days a year.\"\n\n\"[Power generation for data centers] used to be located next to fiber optic cables, but today they want to locate them next to a power source,\" Lance said. \"They prefer that [power generation] is sustainable and renewable but they also recognize that...adequate battery backup is insufficient.\"\n\n\"The whole combination will be an expectation that gas...will be needed for a long period of time,\" he added.\n\nLance expects the industry over the next five-to-10 years will build more gas-fired power generation in the US.\n\n\"We'll need it to solve the energy problem we have and maintain the competitive advantage in energy security, food security and advancements in artificial intelligence,\" he said. \"That will have enormous impacts on every one of your businesses today.\"\n\nLance also said that policymakers need to think two or three years ahead because of the amount of time needed for markets to respond to longer-lead upstream activities.\n\nLonger-term events sometimes result in policy decisions that if implemented, could have drastic effects on markets down the road, Lance said, such as the current pause in permitting new LNG exports. E&P operators that might have been thinking in late 2023 of adding a couple of rigs in the new year, probably didn't anticipate the subsequent drop in gas prices, Lance suggested.\n\n\"So there's this uncertainty that you're sowing the seeds for two, three years down the road,\" he said. \"The [Biden] Administration could have chosen to not pause LNG exports, but the market changes dramatically\" over multiple years.",

The savage act was clearly organised and coordinated by individuals with connections and resources, and we expect the full force of the law to take its course.\"\n\nDPP, through spokesperson Shadric Namalomba, has also called on police to investigate the matter professionally.\n\nNamalomba further pointed a finger at the governing Malawi Congress Party (MCP).\n\nBut MCP publicity secretary Ezekiel Ching'oma, while also calling on the police to investigate the matter, claimed that DPP factions could be to blame for the attack.",

        "body": "It looks like the folks over at Tyson Foods are beginning to find out what happens when you spurn the country that made you for criminal invaders who do nothing but siphon wealth from the American people. Well, someone is doing something about it.\n\nAccording to Fox Business, American Conservative Values, an investment fund created by Ridgeline Research, has announced they're divesting its holdings of Tyson Foods and given the the giant corporation's stock a \"refuse to buy\" rating.\n\nFox Business reported:\n\nThe American Conservative Values ETF, an actively managed exchange-traded fund created by Ridgeline Research LLC to cater to ideologically conservative investors, announced Monday that it divested its holdings of Tyson Foods and placed a \"refuse to buy\" rating on the food giant's stock. Ridgeline founder and CEO Bill Flaig told FOX Business, \"We believe Tyson's management has blundered into a political minefield (and should have known better).\"\n\n\"The risk of alienating a significant percentage of their customers outweighs any potential economic benefit. In a recent Pew Research poll, 80% of U.S. adults say the U.S. government is doing a bad job of handling the migrant influx. We have seen the negative impact of alienating customers recently with Bud Light and Target and by divesting we are protecting our shareholders,\" Flaig added.\n\nThe backlash against Tyson Foods has been going on for years, for various reasons. But, the company's recent decision to close down a plant in Perry, Iowa, laying off nearly 1,300 workers in a town of just less than 8,000, in favor of hiring thousands of criminal invaders illegally on U.S. soil has rubbed many the wrong way.\n\nRelated: Tyson Foods Fires Americans for Criminal Invaders | Things That Need To Be Said\n\nOf course, Tyson Foods released a statement coming out against \"illegal immigration,\" despite Tyson human resource representative Garrett Dolan saying he'd like to employ 42,000 criminal invaders because \"migrants are 'very, very loyal.'\"\n\nIn recent days, there has been a lot of misinformation in the media about our company, and we feel compelled to set the record straight,\" Tyson Foods' statement read. \"Any insinuation that we would cut American jobs to hire immigrant workers is completely false.\"\n\n\"Tyson Foods is strongly opposed to illegal immigration, and we led the way in participating in the two major government programs to help employers combat unlawful employment, E-Verify and the Mutual Agreement between Government and Employers (IMAGE) program,\" the statement added, according to Fox Business.\n\nAnd while Tyson Foods can explain that the Perry plant closing has nothing to do with them looking for and hiring \"migrants\" using a job fair in New York City, it still happened around the same time, which is either intentional or an incredible coincidence.",

        "title": "Tyson Foods Is the Latest Victim of Conservative Misinformation",
        "body": "For days, Tyson Foods has been hit with campaigns for boycotts and is losing major investors, all because it is the latest target of conservative misinformation.\n\nTo be fair, there are actual valid reasons to dislike Tyson Foods. Last year, the company sparked outrage when horrific footage and statements from former employees surfaced, revealing the company did business with suppliers who tortured and mistreated chickens. For its part, Tyson Foods did cut ties with the supplier and did not directly participate in the animal cruelty. Meanwhile, conservatives have never been outspoken supporters of animal rights, raising curiosity about why they are boycotting the company.\n\nOf course, these targeted conservative-led boycotts rarely come from a reasonable place. Usually, as in the cases of Bud Light, Target, and Nike, all a business needs to do is acknowledge the existence of the LGBTQ+ community to draw conservative ire. The recent outrage against Tyson Foods is because the company offered to hire migrant workers for jobs that no one else had expressed interest in.\n\nBacklash against Tyson Foods has been ongoing since March 15, when conservatives began posting false narratives about the company on social media. The initial claim from conservatives was that Tyson Foods fired over 1,000 American workers explicitly so it could replace them all with undocumented immigrants. There is no truth to these outlandish claims, though. Instead, they stem from conservatives' desperate attempts to link two completely unrelated events within the company.\n\nIt is true that Tyson Foods will be laying off 1,276 workers as a result of the company closing a pork plant in Perry, Iowa. The plant is set to close in mid-summer, which is when the layoffs will take effect. Mass layoffs are always devastating, but this one may not have been avoidable given that the pork industry has sustained huge losses since last year, especially in Iowa. It was reported that Iowa pork producers' losses in 2023 were the worst in 25 years due to rising prices. Additionally, Tyson Foods handled the layoffs better than most major companies by announcing the closure months in advance to give its workers time to job search. It also has been encouraging employees to apply to its other plants in Iowa, as it will continue employing an estimated 9,000 people across the state.\n\nMonths before the plant closure, Tyson Foods announced that it was partnering with Tent Partnership for Refugees and had pledged to hire 2,500 refugees over three years. This pledge is actually very helpful, especially in places like Washington and New York City, which have been overwhelmed by an influx of migrants, resulting in overpopulation. At the same time, Tyson Foods has been struggling to fulfill mundane factory jobs at its plants, especially with the current low unemployment rate. Since it first offered unfilled jobs to Americans with little success, it now is offering them to migrants. Although the jobs are unpopular, they will give refugees steady income and access to benefits like healthcare, which could help lower New York City's record-high homeless shelter population.\n\nOf course, conservatives ignored all the information in the last two paragraphs in favor of their own false narrative, declaring that Tyson Foods fired all the employees at the Iowa plant to open up jobs for undocumented immigrants. Suddenly, news sites began posting that Tyson Foods was hiring 52,000 undocumented immigrants. However, at no point did Tyson Foods ever say it was hiring undocumented immigrants. Additionally, the only number provided for how many refugees it planned to hire was 2,500. It seems the false claims arose with Scripps News, which has since retracted its story for significant factual errors. No one can confirm where the 52,000 number came from. Meanwhile, Tyson Foods issued a statement confirming it requires all its employees to be legally authorized to work in the United States.\n\nUnfortunately, the attempt to stop the misinformation has done little to convince conservatives. A conservative investment fund recently split from the company while condemning the hiring of migrant workers over Americans. It's unclear what the outrage is after all the initial clearly false statements were officially debunked. Additionally, offering migrants jobs that Americans aren't applying for in the first place can hardly be seen as special treatment. Of course, none of this matters to conservatives, as this whole thing was never about undocumented immigrants or concern for American jobs.\n\nThe only problem that conservatives have is that a company dared to hire a few migrant workers. They would rather the most unpopular jobs in the country go unfilled than learn that a refugee, who is legally authorized to work, has been offered one. The Tyson Foods boycott is nothing more than conservatives jumping at every opportunity to publicly display their xenophobia, racism, and hatred.",

        "title": "Conservative investment fund divesting from Tyson Foods over hiring asylum-seekers",
        "body": "A conservative-leaning investment fund group has divested itself from Tyson Foods over its practice of hiring asylum-seekers in the United States, cautioning others to avoid investing in the food company as well.\n\nThe decision by American Conservative Values ETF stems from a recent report that Tyson partnered with the nonprofit organization Tent Partnership for Refugees in 2022 to create a program to help refugees find employment. Bill Flaig, the CEO and founder of ACVF's parent company Ridgeline Research LLC, argued that Tyson's management has \"blundered into a political minefield\" over this partnership.\n\n\"The risk of alienating a significant percentage of their customers outweighs any potential economic benefit,\" Flaig told FOX Business. \"In a recent Pew Research poll, 80% of U.S. adults say the U.S. government is doing a bad job of handling the migrant influx. We have seen the negative impact of alienating customers recently with Bud Light and Target and by divesting we are protecting our shareholders.\"\n\nThe report comes as Tyson announced that it would close its plant in Perry, Iowa, this June, impacting 1,276 employees. While company officials have said the closure is unrelated to its hiring practices, Flaig argues that it reinforces \"how inadequate that response is to Americans concerned about the open border.\"\n\nTyson denied the accusations in a statement. \"In recent days, there has been a lot of misinformation in the media about our company, and we feel compelled to set the record straight. Any insinuation that we would cut American jobs to hire immigrant workers is completely false.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"Tyson Foods is strongly opposed to illegal immigration, and we led the way in participating in the two major government programs to help employers combat unlawful employment, E-Verify and the Mutual Agreement between Government and Employers (IMAGE) program,\" the statement continues.\n\nTyson is just one company ACVF recommends conservatives avoid investing in, including Delta Air Lines, Blackrock, the Walt Disney Company, Apple, Netflix, and Starbucks.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.\n\nTypically overlooked in the annals of Air Max is 2017's Vapormax Plus, a top seller for Nike that continues its run with little to no marketing by the brand. That's because the silhouette has built up quite a reputation among its regulars, flying off store shelves on a regular basis -- even at the elevated $210 MSRP.\n\nNike's been re-releasing several colorways from years prior, simply due to the obvious demand of the shoe. Running parallel to that strategy are some simple, monochromatic propositions like this \"Emerald\" pair, that goes completely unhinged in green. We've seen Nike go uni-color with this model before, offering the silhouette in bold hot pinks, reds, and more.\n\nWhile you won't find these getting the spotlight on the SNKRS App or on any podcast discussion, the Vapormax Plus is interested in one thing only -- putting the team on its back and bringing Air to feet.

        "title": "John Deere Accelerates Manufacturing Innovation With Private 5G",
        "body": "I recently toured two John Deere facilities in the heart of the American Midwest. The company traces its roots back to 1837, when its namesake, a blacksmith, developed the first self-scouring steel plow, which revolutionized farming at the time. Fast-forward almost 190 years, and John Deere continues to innovate on many fronts.\n\nVisiting the company's Tractor & Engine Museum and its 5G-connected factory -- both in Waterloo, Iowa -- were eye-opening experiences. In this piece I'll talk about how the company is leveraging cellular connectivity to enable automation and autonomy in its iconic green-and-yellow vehicles, as well as using 5G to unlock efficiencies within the factories that produce them.\n\nOne might not immediately associate an agrarian brand like John Deere with cutting-edge technology, but that would be a mistake. The company has opened research facilities and labs in Iowa as well as tech hotspots including Austin and San Francisco. Furthermore, Deere acquisitions such as Blue River Technology are bringing together smart people and technologies such as computer vision, machine learning, AI and cloud-native infrastructure to revolutionize farming operations. Add in Deere's significant research and development spending -- in the billions of dollars annually -- and you're looking at an impressive commitment to making agriculture smarter.\n\nThe same could be said for Deere's early recognition of the power of private 5G communications. In 2020, the company began its 5G deployment journey by procuring dedicated spectrum licenses through the Citizens Broadband Radio Service, managed by the OnGo Alliance. Not wanting to be dependent on a third party for the design, deployment and operation of its cellular network, Deere chose to build an internal team of network engineers to work with Nokia. They did their initial work in record time, requiring only an astounding six weeks to stand up a production network. From my perspective, both the decision to field an in-house team and the jaw-droppingly fast execution that followed speak volumes about the company's confidence in its technical chops and its desire to accelerate vertical integration of its manufacturing processes.\n\nThe manufacturing use cases that are benefiting from Deere's investment in a private 5G network are noteworthy. To date, the company has deployed more than 100 automated guided vehicles controlled via 5G to move engines, drivetrains, cabs, wheels and other parts within the assembly process. Computer vision, leveraging 5G's ultra-low latency and fast data throughput, is used to inspect welds for quality control as well as monitor worker safety. Last but certainly not least, 5G connectivity is enabling Deere to improve its assembly-line processes. It can help with focused tasks such as wirelessly measuring torque levels on power tools to ensure optimal workflows, and it can be applied on a broader scale to reconfigure assembly lines in hours rather than days or weeks to maximize operational efficiency.\n\nOne might ask why John Deere has chosen 5G cellular connectivity over Wi-Fi and its accompanying \"free\" underlying unlicensed spectrum. The answer to that question is multifold. 5G cellular connectivity is inherently more deterministic than Wi-Fi, given smoother handoffs from radio to radio. 5G can also support a vastly greater number of devices per radio -- Deere reports up to 800 per radio within its private 5G cellular network. This contrasts with the company's prior experience, in which a single Wi-Fi access point handled only 50 devices. In operational technology environments like Deere's, industrial IoT deployments dramatically expand the number of devices that connect to a network for scenarios such as predictive maintenance; the economics associated with Wi-Fi densification to address these needs quickly escalate beyond what's affordable. As a bonus, 5G's architectural design also provides an improved security posture over Wi-Fi in the form of enhanced encryption. That's an important consideration, given the vulnerabilities that often result from the expanded attack surface typically associated with large IoT deployments.\n\nBeyond its technical and security superpowers, 5G's fiber-like throughput and latency profile offer flexibility when it comes to installation and access. For example, it's often impractical to run Ethernet to cranes, hoists and overhead connected devices such as smart cameras -- yet it's easy to connect these using 5G. Furthermore, cellular spectrum can propagate over larger expanses, both indoors and out, providing dependable connectivity for objects in motion. This is especially relevant for manufacturing workflows such as yard management, drive audits, rollover testing and trailer tracking.\n\nFrom my perspective, John Deere is leaning into 5G to gain a competitive advantage in producing some of the most technically advanced, safe and reliable agricultural implements to help feed the world. It's an endeavor that solidly reflects the company's core values of integrity, quality, commitment and innovation.\n\n5G's deployment flexibility, high-speed throughput and ultra-low latency is clearly unlocking new value for Deere by improving its ability to process data, perform analytics and provide actionable insights in near real-time to optimize its manufacturing processes. The company is an early trailblazer in its use of cellular connectivity to accelerate its digital transformation journey and modernize its manufacturing processes, and other world-class manufacturers should consider the same.",

        "title": "3 Ways To Be A Better Leader, According To American Express Executive Denise Pickett",
        "body": "There are so many ways to become a better leader. From mentoring and sponsoring young professionals to taking advice from other people in leadership, good leaders are open to learning every day. That's an important part of leadership according to Denise Pickett, the president of the Global Services Group at American Express. She has been with the Fortune 500 company for over thirty years. But she isn't just another high achieving corporate leader. According to her long-time colleague Anr\u00e9 Williams, Pickett has been an example of what it means to lead with purpose.\n\n\"I've known and worked with Denise for over twenty five years. She has always championed creating an inclusive environment where everyone's voice is heard and all feel valued. Her passion for being an inspiring people leader has set a high standard within our company,\" said Willams, who is the CEO of American Express National Bank and group president of enterprise services at American Express.\n\nLike her colleagues at American Express, Pickett is on a mission to encourage and help women in corporate roles thrive. As a female leader she believes it's crucial that women uplift and support one another endlessly. It's important to note that the Toronto native has felt very supported by American Express as a woman in leadership. According to data provided by American Express, 40.5% of their senior vice presidents and above are women and 44% of the company's sixteen officers are women. I spoke with global enterprise leader Denise Pickett about three ways to become a better leader.\n\nWhen it comes to professional development there is always room for improvement. Even leaders should be open to learning from their employers, colleagues, and other leaders. Pickett believes professionals should be open to learning at all times.\n\n\"I think it's on the job training. My dad had a manufacturing job. He learned and watched other people do it. Leadership is no different,\" she said. \"It starts when you have that first direct report and you're a manager, then as you move in your career and you get more responsibility, you learn to lead others. I went from having my first direct report thirty years ago to now 37,000 people. I have to make sure I'm leading people well,\" she told me.\n\nThe experienced business leader thinks everyone should be open to learning at any stage of their career, but especially when you are just getting started. \"It's about learning from all of the people that are your sponsors, that are advocating for you, and that you work for. As a woman leader, I set an example for other women. I take that role seriously, which is why I lead our Global Women's Interest Network,\" Pickett said.\n\nOne of the best ways to become a better leader is to assist young people with developing professional and personal goals. Mentorship doesn't have to be tedious. It could just be a monthly half hour Zoom call to discuss future goals, work stressors, and how to leave a job in a professional manner. For Pickett, having mentors has been life changing.\n\n\"I have been very fortunate to have both mentors and sponsors at American Express. I looked for that early in my career. I looked for people that would guide and help me. I even went externally to seek that guidance,\" she said. She specifically mentioned one person who helped her with all things career development.\n\n\"Early in my career there was a woman named Judy Elder I knew from the industry in Toronto. She mentored me around getting involved in the marketing industry early in my career. She gave this wonderful speech and it really stuck with me about being ambitious for yourself and being ambitious for others,\" she told me.\n\nPickett believes companies benefit from having employee resource groups (ERGs), also known as affinity groups. At American Express these cultural groups are called colleague networks. \"We have fourteen colleague networks at American Express. Our women's interest network is one of those. The Women's Interest Network is the largest network at American Express. We have twenty chapters in sixteen different countries. It's about making sure that we're talking about leadership, the community, and ambition,\" she said.\n\nAmerican Express is one of many prominent companies that has employee resources groups, culturally conscious events, and a solid diversity statement. But not all large companies with diversity efforts and initiatives are psychologically safe for people from underrepresented groups. Part of advocating for inclusion means creating safe spaces for employees from all walks of life.\n\nPickett made it clear that she's felt very supported by colleagues and leaders at American Express over the past thirty years. That is partially due to being able to be her authentic self. She thinks everyone should work somewhere that advocates for inclusion but also gives people the liberty to be true to themselves. \"Let folks be their authentic selves. I think that's even more important than it was earlier in my career. I see how important that is today. The other thing about inclusive leadership is respecting different perspectives,\" she told me.\n\nInclusive leadership matters year round. As Women's History Month comes to a close, remember that the voices, stories, and contributions of female leaders should be recognized year round. Female executives like Pickett have opened doors for women who want to work in leadership. So, now you've seen what it takes to become a better leader. Don't forget that if you are a corporate leader you are likely in a place of privilege. People in leadership should use their knowledge and power to make the workplace more inclusive, open-minded, and psychological safe.",

        "title": "James Robinson III, who moved American Express beyond cards, dies at 88",
        "body": "The death was caused by respiratory failure related to pneumonia, according to a family statement.\n\nMr. Robinson retained much of his Georgia upbringing: a Southern lilt, genteel manners and the homespun handle \"Jimmy Three Sticks\" from the Roman numerals in his name. As a corporate head, though, he was right at home in Manhattan's winner-take-all ethos during a time when companies were being gobbled up and brinkmanship ruled.\n\nHe was on the losing side in one of biggest corporate bidding wars of the 1980s, the 1988 scramble to control tobacco and food colossus RJR Nabisco that hit an eventual price tag of $25 billion. But later, Mr. Robinson helped bring sweeping changes to Wall Street by tirelessly lobbying for the deregulation of the financial industry.\n\nThe Depression-era rules were lifted by Congress in 1999, six years after Mr. Robinson was pushed out at American Express. In Washington, Mr. Robinson was sometimes called the secretary of state for corporate America.\n\n\"When I found something that interested me, I pursued it aggressively,\" he once said.\n\nMr. Robinson moved into the chief executive suites at American Express in 1977 after an internal power struggle that left him on top. He was eager to shake up a company with roots stretching back to before the Civil War. To Mr. Robinson, American Express had grown too complacent sticking with its flagship credit cards and traveler's checks and services.\n\nHis acquisition hunt began almost immediately. Mr. Robinson made an unsuccessful bid in 1978 for the publishing company McGraw Hill, seeking to expand the Amex portfolio into media. He followed up by striking a deal with Warner Communications for a stake in emerging cable television systems.\n\nAmerican Express ended the cable deal in 1985, but not before Mr. Robinson put forth a prescient vision of how nearly everything -- financial services, stock trades and credit card payments -- would eventually migrate to online platforms. He used the analogy of a rail line for the future digital reach into homes and noted his desire to own that access.\n\n\"Once you get a railroad track,\" he told the New York Times, \"you want to put as much across it as you can.\"\n\nHis biggest target became one of the capstone moments of the wild 1980s. Mr. Robinson gave the green light to one of Amex's crown jewels, the newly merged investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton, to back an RJR Nabisco management group seeking to take control. An offer of $75 a share was made to take the company private.\n\nThe announcement opened the gates. Nearly every private equity firm put up bids with Nabisco in play. Mr. Robinson became a close adviser to the Nabisco management faction, led by the highflying chief executive F. Ross Johnson. In the end, the company directors accepted a $109-a-share buyout deal with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, or KKR, valued at nearly $25 billion and setting a new high bar in the 1980s takeover frenzy.\n\nThe outcome pushed most of RJR Nabisco's top executives out the door, but all with big paydays from stocks and severance. Johnson walked away $50 million richer. \"A Game of Greed,\" read the headline of a Time magazine cover featuring Johnson. \"Has the buyout craze gone too far?\"\n\nIn the 1989 bestseller \"Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco,\" journalists Bryan Burrough and John Helyar described Johnson meeting Mr. Robinson at a bar shortly after the acquisition was sealed by KKR, which soon began to sell off the company piece by piece.\n\n\"The game is over. We've played it into overtime,\" Johnson was quoted as telling Mr. Robinson. \"Whether they gave you an elbow in the eye or crack-blocked your butt end, it doesn't matter. That's the score. Let's get on with our lives.\" (In a 1993 HBO movie based on the book, Mr. Robinson was played by Fred Thompson, who served as a Republican U.S. senator from Tennessee from 1994 to 2003.)\n\nBy the early 1990s, Mr. Robinson had remade American Express into a force on Wall Street and beyond. Besides Shearson Lehman Hutton, Mr. Robinson's growing Amex family had holdings that included the mutual fund company Investors Diversified Services, payment service firm First Data and the Fireman's Fund insurance company.\n\nHe often said his goal was to construct a comprehensive \"financial supermarket\" that ranged from boutique services for the wealthiest investors to credit cards and travel reservations. He had the support of the board and shareholders when the markets were strong.\n\nBut when the rush of the 1980s ran its course, the blame fell on Mr. Robinson for seemingly pushing too hard, too fast and taking his eye off Amex's core products.\n\nShearson Lehman Brothers (which later broke apart) posted a jarring loss of $166 million for the last quarter of 1992, dragged down by tanking property investments and other ill-fated bets. The American Express green and gold cards -- pillars of the company for decades -- began to lose market share as rivals promised lower fees and better perks. Company shares dropped to about half their highs during the 1980s.\n\nShareholders wanted Mr. Robinson out. Some board members, previously strong allies, also turned against him. He was given a smooth exit, however. Mr. Robinson was allowed to spend his last months as chief executive using the Central Park-view penthouse the company bought as his city base. He left the company in February 1993, citing personal reasons, with a \"golden parachute\" package valued at up to $10 million.\n\n\"We had a great run during the '80s,\" Mr. Robinson said. \"We got a little too cocky.\"\n\nJames Dixon Robinson III was born Nov. 19, 1935, in Atlanta and raised in the city's Buckhead district. His father chairman of the First National Bank of Atlanta; his mother was a homemaker.\n\nHe graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1957 with a degree in industrial management, then served in the Navy for two years. He received his master's degree in business administration in 1961 from Harvard Business School and began his career with New York-based Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.\n\nIn 1968, Mr. Robinson became a partner at White Weld & Co., a financial services firm. He joined American Express in 1970 as an executive vice president.\n\nHe shuttled often between New York and Washington as the main Amex envoy with lawmakers and White House staff. The main goal was seeking to end rules that prohibited a financial company from operating as both a commercial bank and a brokerage. In 1999, Congress repealed much of the nearly 70-year-old restrictions, known as the Glass-Steagall Act.\n\nYet the more freewheeling market introduced a new landscape, including subprime mortgages and other high-risk investments that contributed to the global financial crisis in 2008.\n\nAfter leaving Amex, Mr. Robinson founded RRE Ventures, a New York-based venture capital firm whose investments include women-led start-ups and cryptocurrency ventures. He also served as a director at Coca-Cola from 1975 to 2014.\n\nHis marriage to Bettye Bradley ended in a divorce. Mr. Robinson married the former Linda Gosden, a public relations executive, in 1984. Survivors include two children from his first marriage; two children from his second marriage; a sister; and six grandchildren.\n\nLast year, Mr. Robinson and his wife put their six-bedroom Park Avenue residence on the market for $25 million. The couple purchased the 6,500-square-foot co-op in 2000, but the aura of Mr. Robinson's Amex years was still strong. Real estate journals in New York described the place as giving prospective buyers a connection, even if loosely, to the lore of the 1980s boom time.",

What we are presented with here, however, is a petition for mandamus relief after a district judge ruled that application of the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege justified an order compelling production of certain documents generated by in-house counsel for the patent holder. Petitioners are Abbott Laboratories, Abbvie Inc., Abbvie Products LLC, Unimed Pharmaceuticals LLC, and Besins Healthcare, Inc. They contend that a writ of mandamus relief is the only means available to them to preserve confidentiality, which should extend to documents they claim are privileged. Respondents include various drug manufacturers who argue that mandamus should not lie because Petitioners (1) have failed to show that the District Court committed a clear and indisputable abuse of discretion; (2) have another adequate remedy; and (3) will not suffer irreparable injury. Because Petitioners fail to meet the high bar set for granting a petition for writ of mandamus, we will deny their petition.\n\nII.\u2003Factual Background\n\nPetitioners Abbvie and BHI owned a now-expired patent (the '894 patent), protecting AndroGel 1%, a topical drug used to treat patients with low testosterone. FTC v. AbbVie Inc., 976 F.3d 327, 341-42 (3d Cir. 2020) (\"FTC II\"). The original patent application, which the patent examiner rejected, \"claimed all penetration enhancers.\" Id. at 341. It was later amended \"to recite at least one of 24 penetration enhancers,\" among them isopropyl myristate and isostearic acid, though not isopropyl palmitate. Id. The claimed pharmaceutical composition for the patent that ultimately issued had been reduced to a formulation with only a single enhancer: isopropyl myristate. Id. at 342.\n\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides a regulatory scheme for testing and approving new drugs. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355; FTC v. Actavis, Inc., 570 U.S. 136, 142-44, 133 S.Ct. 2223, 186 L.Ed.2d 343 (2013); see In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig. Indirect Purchaser Class, 868 F.3d 132, 143-44 (3d Cir. 2017). The Act provides special procedures for approving brand-name and generic drugs, as well as \"for identifying, and resolving, related patent disputes.\" Actavis, Inc., 570 U.S. at 143, 133 S.Ct. 2223. Following these procedures, drug companies Perrigo Company (\"Perrigo\") and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (\"Teva\") sought FDA approval for generic Androgel 1% formulations. FTC II, 976 F.3d at 342-43. Perrigo's version specified a formulation using isostearic acid as its penetration enhancer, while Teva specified a formulation using isopropyl palmitate (which Petitioners later argued was equivalent to isopropyl myristate). Id. at 343. Both companies certified under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b)(2) that Petitioners' '894 patent was invalid or not infringed by their own formulations. Id. at 343-44, 361. Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iii), Petitioners then -- as owners of the '894 patent -- had \"45 days to decide whether to sue.\" Id. at 340.\n\nPetitioners sued Perrigo for infringement in the District of New Jersey. Id. at 344. They then contacted Perrigo only days later to discuss settling the lawsuit, offering to pay Perrigo $500,000. Ultimately, Abbott paid Perrigo $2,000,000, with Perrigo agreeing in exchange to delay marketing its generic 1% testosterone gel until January 1, 2015, or until another version entered the market, whichever occurred first. Id. Abbott also sued and settled with Teva, agreeing to license Teva to market its generic gel beginning on December 27, 2014. Id. The FDA later approved Perrigo's and Teva's products, which used isostearic acid and isopropyl palmitate, respectively. Id. at 345.\n\nIII.\u2003Procedural Background\n\nThe procedural history of this and related litigation is lengthy and has begun to resemble the many heads of Hydra. On October 31, 2011, Petitioners filed a lawsuit against Perrigo (the \"Perrigo Lawsuit\") through their outside counsel, Munger, Tolles & Olson, LLP (\"Munger Tolles\") and Foley & Lardner LLP (\"Foley Lardner\"). Petitioners alleged that \"the submission of [Perrigo's new drug application] \u2024 constitutes infringement by Perrigo \u2024 of the '894 Patent\" and that \"any commercial manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of Perrigo's Generic AndroGel\u00ae would infringe the '894 Patent.\" App. 272. Munger Tolles and Foley Lardner certified that the Perrigo Lawsuit was \"not being presented for any improper purpose.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1).\n\nIn 2014, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") filed an antitrust suit in the District Court against Petitioners, alleging that Petitioners \"maintained an illegal monopoly through the filing of sham patent infringement lawsuits against two potential competitors,\" i.e., Perrigo and Teva. See FTC v. AbbVie Inc., 329 F. Supp. 3d 98, 106 (E.D. Pa. 2018) (\"FTC I\"). In early interrogatory responses, Petitioners averred that their outside counsel Munger Tolles and Foley Lardner \"w[ere] responsible for, involved in, or contributed to [the] decisions to file the \u2024 Perrigo [l]itigation.\" App. 248. By the time of trial, Petitioners asserted that \"internal counsel for Abbott Products\" made \"[t]he ultimate decision to sue Perrigo in 2011.\" App. 661. In ruling against AbbVie after a bench trial, the District Court reasoned that internal counsel \"had actual knowledge\" that the lawsuit was \"baseless\" and that \"they acted in bad faith.\" FTC I, 329 F. Supp. 3d at 126. The lawsuit's sole purpose, the District Court concluded, \"was to impose expense and delay [on] Perrigo.\" Id.\n\nWe upheld the District Court, leaving undisturbed its finding that AbbVie had filed an objectively baseless lawsuit in bad faith to injure a potential competitor. FTC II, 976 F.3d at 371. We explained: \"[T]he [District] Court was permitted to conclude \u2024 that in filing an objectively baseless lawsuit against Perrigo, the decisionmakers were motivated not to assert a patent in good faith, but to impose expense and delay \u2024\" Id.\n\nAfter our decision in FTC II, Respondents in the instant matter filed suit in 2019 against Petitioners, in the case of King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v. Abbott Laboratories, et al., No. 2:19-cv-03565 (E.D. Pa.) (\"the King lawsuit\"). They alleged antitrust claims under the Sherman Act, arguing that patent-infringement lawsuits including the Perrigo suit delayed market entry of generic AndroGel 1%. Respondents moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that FTC II had preclusive effect as to whether the Perrigo lawsuit constituted sham litigation. The District Court declined to apply issue preclusion but held, once again, that the Perrigo litigation was objectively baseless.\n\nAfter discovery commenced in the King lawsuit, Respondents moved to compel production of 211 documents, which they argued revealed Petitioners' in-house counsel's views about the baselessness of suing the generic drug manufacturers in the Perrigo lawsuit. Respondents contended that because both the District Court and this court in FTC II had already held that the Perrigo litigation was objectively baseless, any communication by Petitioners' in-house counsel concerning whether to file that suit constituted a communication in furtherance of fraud, and that such communication would not be protected by the attorney-client privilege due to the crime-fraud exception. Petitioners maintained that the attorney-client privilege applies. The District Court asked Respondents to prepare and provide a list of 100 documents for it to review in camera. Petitioners asked the District Court for permission to appeal that ruling under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), but their motion was denied.\n\nAfter reviewing the challenged documents in camera, the District Court ordered Petitioners to produce nineteen documents. The District Judge explained that, \"it is reasonable to infer from their legal research and analysis that [the attorneys] knew the filing of the litigation would be a sham,\" and thus, since the attorneys were \"key decisionmakers who directed the filing of sham litigation,\" \"it is reasonable to conclude that the attorneys used their own legal research and analysis -- the documents at issue here -- in furtherance of fraud.\" App. 183-84.\n\nPetitioners then sought a writ of mandamus, the matter now before us. It seeks vacatur of the District Court's orders dated March 27, 2023, and July 20, 2023 -- the orders which had directed Petitioners to produce documents for which they claimed privilege, and to which the District Court had concluded the crime-fraud exception applied. The District Court has stayed its order compelling production of the documents pending our decision.\n\nIV.\u2003History of the Writ of Mandamus\n\nThe writ of mandamus has a long history, likely reaching back to the 16th century. Despite that lineage, courts have granted it sparingly. After the first mandamus statute's enactment in 1710, courts were \"either reluctant to or [\u2009] prevented from asserting supervisory authority\" with respect to writs of mandamus and certiorari. Leonard Goodman, Mandamus in the Colonies-The Rise of the Superintending Power of American Courts, The Am. J. of Legal Hist. Vol. I, 4 at 310 (Oct. 1957). Indeed, writing in 1768, Blackstone described mandamus as a \"high prerogative writ,\" emphasizing its discretionary nature. 3 William Blackstone, Commentaries 110. Over time, courts in England expressed reservations about granting mandamus if a party could seek recourse by pursuing some other remedy. See Audrey Davis, Note, A Return to the Traditional Use of the Writ of Mandamus, 24 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 1527, 1536 (2020) (citing R. v. Governor of the Bank of Eng., 99 Eng. Rep. 334, 334 (1780); T.E. Tomlins, A Digested Index to the Seven Volumes of Term Reports in the Court of King's Bench 127 (1799)). The availability of a remedy in equity also barred mandamus. See R. v. Marquis of Stafford, 100 Eng. Rep. 782, 785 (1790).\n\nMandamus figured prominently in early United States Supreme Court jurisprudence. The Supreme Court first dealt with mandamus in U.S. v. Lawrence, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 42, 1 L.Ed. 502 (1795), and in that case denied the writ. The landmark case of Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), came before the Supreme Court on a writ of mandamus, sought by William Marbury and three others similarly situated when, after being appointed Justices of the Peace in the District of Columbia, their commissions were not delivered. There, Chief Justice Marshall discussed the writ's origin and use and cabined its appropriateness to those instances when a party has no other legal remedy. Id. at 168-69. Since the eighteenth century, the Supreme Court has continued to emphasize the \"extraordinary\" nature of mandamus relief. See, e.g., U.S. Alkali Export Ass'n v. United States, 325 U.S. 196, 202-03, 65 S.Ct. 1120, 89 L.Ed. 1554 (1945); Ex parte Fahey, 332 U.S. 258, 259-60, 67 S.Ct. 1558, 91 L.Ed. 2041 (1947); Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court, 542 U.S. 367, 380, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004).\n\nV.\u2003Mandamus Jurisdiction Standard of Review\n\nThis Court has authority to issue writs of mandamus pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). In re Chambers Dev. Co., Inc., 148 F.3d 214, 223 (3d Cir. 1998). The writ of mandamus is an \"extreme\" remedy reserved for only the most \"extraordinary situations.\" Haines, 975 F.2d at 88 (quoting Kerr v. U.S. Dist. Court, 426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976)); see Will v. United States, 389 U.S. 90, 95, 88 S.Ct. 269, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967). To obtain mandamus relief, Petitioners must show: \"(1) a clear and indisputable abuse of discretion or error of law, (2) a lack of an alternate avenue for adequate relief, and (3) a likelihood of irreparable injury.\" In re Howmedica Osteonics Corp., 867 F.3d 390, 401 (3d Cir. 2017) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). When laying out mandamus requirements, the Supreme Court explained that petitioners must \"demonstrate a 'clear abuse of discretion,' or conduct amounting to 'usurpation of [the judicial] power.'\u2009\" Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for S. Dist. of Iowa, 490 U.S. 296, 309, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989) (internal citations omitted). By grouping \"clear abuse of discretion\" with something as egregious as a usurpation of judicial power, the Supreme Court conveyed that a clear and indisputable abuse of discretion standard presents a high bar. Moreover, even if Petitioners here can make the three-pronged showing set forth above, this Court still has broad discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny a mandamus petition. See, e.g., In re McGraw-Hill Glob. Educ. Holdings, LLC, 909 F.3d 48, 57 (3d Cir. 2018); Cheney, 542 U.S. at 381, 124 S.Ct. 2576.\n\nWe will deny the petition for a writ of mandamus, as Petitioners fail to clear the high bar this Court requires for mandamus relief to be awarded.\n\nVI.\u2003Analysis\n\na. PETITIONERS HAVE IDENTIFIED NO CLEAR AND INDISPUTABLE RIGHT TO RELIEF\n\ni.\u2003Sham Litigation Triggering the Crime-Fraud Exception\n\nTo satisfy the Supreme Court's two-part definition of sham litigation, (1) \"the lawsuit must be objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits,\" and (2) \"the baseless lawsuit [must] conceal[\u2009] an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor through the use [of] the governmental process -- as opposed to the outcome of that process -- as an anticompetitive weapon.\" Pro. Real Est. Invs., Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 60-61, 113 S.Ct. 1920, 123 L.Ed.2d 611 (1993) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); see Hanover 3201 Realty, LLC v. Vill. Supermarkets, Inc., 806 F.3d 162, 179 (3d Cir. 2015). It follows, then, that sham litigation is a \"wrongdoing\" that involves a client's intentional \"misuse\" of the legal process for an \"improper purpose.\" In re Grand Jury, 705 F.3d 133, 151, 157 (3d Cir. 2012) (internal citation omitted). And as we have said, albeit outside the antitrust context, a client's intentional \"misuse [of] [an] attorney's advice in furtherance of\" \"wrongdoing\" undertaken for an \"improper purpose,\" triggers the crime-fraud exception. Id.\n\nThe central merits question before us, therefore, is whether sham litigation is a type of fraud which may form the basis for a party to invoke the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege. We have found no binding precedent that squarely answers this question, nor have the parties pointed us to any. And Petitioners concede as much. While acknowledging that \"this Court has not directly opined on the meaning of 'fraud' in the exception,\" Petitioners nevertheless argue that \"this Court's decisions are all consistent with an understanding of fraud that requires deception regarding a material fact.\" Pet. at 16 (internal citation omitted) (emphasis added). This is simply not the stuff of which \"binding authority\" is cast. Without such authority, mandamus petitioners \"do not come close to demonstrating\" that the District Court committed a clear error or an abuse of discretion in concluding that sham litigation may trigger application of the crime-fraud exception. Republic of Venez. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 287 F.3d 192, 199 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (concluding petitioners failed to show clear error where no binding authority existed and sister circuits were split on the issue at hand).\n\nWithout binding authority to guide it, the District Court's conclusion that sham litigation triggers the crime-fraud exception was not a \"clear and indisputable abuse of discretion or error of law.\" In re Howmedica, 867 F.3d at 401. In short, there was no usurpation of judicial power. The Supreme Court has recognized that the crime-fraud exception applies when attorney advice \"refers \u2024 to future wrongdoing.\" Zolin, 491 U.S. at 562-63, 109 S.Ct. 2619 (quoting 8 Wigmore \u00a7 2298, at 573). And as Respondents note, we have broadly understood \"wrongdoings\" to include not only crimes but also torts. See United States v. Doe, 429 F.3d 450, 454 (3d Cir. 2005); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 604 F.2d 798, 802 (3d Cir. 1979). Further, we have recognized that \"[a]ll that is necessary is that the client misuse or intend to misuse the attorney's advice in furtherance of an improper purpose. When this occurs, the purpose of the privilege, to promote the fair administration of justice, has been undermined and the privilege no longer applies.\" In re Grand Jury, 705 F.3d at 157 (internal citation omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nPetitioners argue that the District Court clearly erred in holding that sham litigation triggers the crime-fraud exception because it relied on an \"egregious misreading\" of In re Chevron, 633 F.3d 153 (3d Cir. 2011). Pet. at 18. Petitioners are wrong. As Respondents contend, In re Chevron is easily distinguishable from what is before us.\n\nThere, after Chevron's corporate predecessor was sued in Ecuador, an Ecuadorian court appointed \"global damages expert\" Richard Stalin Cabrera Vega (\"Cabrera\"). 633 F.3d at 157-58. Cabrera's team of fourteen experts included Juan Crist\u00f3bal Villao Yepez (\"Villao\"), who happened to be employed by the New Jersey environmental firm that plaintiffs in that suit had hired as a consultant. Id. at 159. After learning of Villao's \"dual employment,\" Chevron made discovery requests and invoked the crime-fraud exception as a means of piercing the attorney-client privilege. Id. at 159-60. In affirming the District Court's application of the crime-fraud exception, our Court explained that it viewed the dual employment as a \"conflict of interest.\" Id. at 166. We elaborated that the \"showing of Villao's dual employment [was] sufficient to make a prima facie showing of a fraud that satisfies the first element\" needed for the crime-fraud exception to apply. Id. In the case before us, the District Court reasoned that \"[i]f an expert's conflict of interest in a foreign court can be a fraud, surely the filing of a sham lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey can be a fraud.\" App. 14. This a fortiari comparison was reasonable and hardly suggests a misreading of In re Chevron.\n\nCertainly not all frivolous litigation falls within the crime-fraud exception. Frivolous litigation may trigger Rule 11 sanctions, but that will not, by itself, allow access to material otherwise shielded by the attorney-client privilege. Our focus is limited to what qualifies as \"sham litigation.\" Here, it is the lawsuit's baselessness, combined with the client's subjective intent to interfere with administrative and judicial procedures associated with patent rights, that triggers the crime-fraud exception.\n\nii.\u2003Reliance Requirement\n\nPetitioners next argue that the District Court, \"committed an additional clear error\" by not applying a \"reliance\" requirement. Pet. at 22. This argument also fails. As Respondents explain, the crime-fraud exception, as this Court has articulated it, applies if \"the client was \u2024 intending to commit a fraud or crime, and [\u2009] the attorney-client communications were in furtherance of that\" attempt. Chevron, 633 F.3d at 166 (quoting In re Grand Jury Investigation, 445 F.3d 266, 274 (3d Cir. 2006)). In none of our opinions addressing the crime-fraud exception have we embraced a reliance requirement.\n\nWe have explained that \"where the client consults the attorney for the purpose of committing a future [\u2009] fraud, the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege applies and communications made in furtherance of the anticipated [\u2009] fraud are not protected from disclosure as recognition of 'the privilege is no longer defensible.'\u2009\" Id. (quoting In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 604 F.2d at 802) (internal quotation marks omitted). That understanding stems from the Supreme Court's instruction that \"[i]t is the purpose of the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege to assure that the seal of secrecy between lawyer and client does not extend to communications made for the purpose of getting advice for the commission of a fraud or crime.\" Zolin, 491 U.S. at 563, 109 S.Ct. 2619 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Moreover, a party who invokes the crime-fraud exception can satisfy the fraud requirement by demonstrating nothing more than that \"the client was \u2024 intending to commit a fraud.\" Pallares v. Kohn (In re Chevron Corp.), 650 F.3d 276, 291 (3d Cir. 2011) (internal citation omitted); see also Clark v. United States, 289 U.S. 1, 15, 53 S.Ct. 465, 77 L.Ed. 993 (1933) (\"The privilege takes flight if the relation is abused. A client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law.\").\n\nThe District Court followed our Court's case law, noting that \"the decisions of the Third Circuit \u2024 have described fraud in the crime-fraud exception to include advice as to attempted or intended fraud,\" and \"[i]f the fraud does not have to be consummated, there can be no requirement of reliance.\" App. 8. The District Court did not clearly err in holding that \"the law of the Third Circuit applies the crime-fraud exception without the need for reliance.\" Id.\n\nWe will not consider Petitioners' argument that \"attempted fraud\" requires an \"attempt to induce\" reliance, Pet. at 23. As Respondents explain, this argument was raised for the first time in the filing of the Petition. Because the argument was not raised in the District Court, Petitioners have forfeited it. See Newark Morning Ledger Co. v. United States, 539 F.2d 929, 932 (3d Cir. 1976).\n\niii.\u2003The 'In Furtherance of' Prong\n\nPetitioners argue that the District Court adopted the mistaken view that this Court \"\u2009'has broadly interpreted the scope of communications or work product that implicate the crime-fraud exception' under the 'in furtherance of' requirement.\" Pet. at 27 (quoting App. 184). Again, Petitioners are seeking to stretch pronouncements in our case law beyond their intended reach.\n\nThe crime-fraud exception does not extend to communications that \"merely relate to the crime or fraud\" or \"merely opine[\u2009] on the lawfulness of a particular course of conduct.\" In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 745 F.3d 681, 693 (3d Cir. 2014); see also In re Grand Jury, 445 F.3d 266, 276-77 (3d Cir. 2006). But here, the District Court zeroed in on an array of documents that provided \"a reasonable basis to suspect that AbbVie and [BHI] intended to file sham litigation for the purpose of preventing or delaying Perrigo from entering the testosterone replacement market.\" App. 185.\n\nThe District Court identified four documents demonstrating that \"the attorneys were well-aware that they had a 45-day period after receiving Perrigo's letter to file a lawsuit before the 30-month stay expired.\" App. 186 (citing Exs. 2, 15, 30, 39). They also knew that \"[i]f they received the 30-month stay, Perrigo would not be able to enter the market until late March 2014.\" Id. Another document, dated over 15 days before the infringement action against Perrigo was filed, revealed in-house counsel \"discussing internally their settlement proposal, not about what Perrigo might pay them but instead what they might pay Perrigo.\" App. 187. And the District Court recognized that \"[i]n two documents, the attorneys examined statistics about the typical length for patent cases to be resolved in various district courts.\" App. 186 (citing Exs. 21, 61). The documents show that the attorneys believed that New Jersey, where the case was ultimately filed, often takes \"notably longer than [\u2009] other district courts in the country\" \"to resolve patent cases.\" Id. Ironically, the in-house lawyers appeared to regard judicial delay as an ally.\n\nWe have recognized the fact that a client \"could gain\" information from questions an attorney posed as \"sufficient \u2024 to conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the advice was used in furtherance of a crime or fraud.\" In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 745 F.3d at 691. This is true even if it is \"impossible to know what [the] [c]lient thought or how he processed the information gained from [his] [a]ttorney\" so long as the correspondence itself \"would lead logically\" to the client committing a wrongdoing. Id. at 693.\n\nIn the case before us, the pre-filing documents \"would lead logically\" to an inference that in-house counsel filed a sham lawsuit to trigger the 30-month stay. Id. The documents show in-house counsel's focus on research related to pursuing sham litigation. Thus, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the pre-filing documents were in furtherance of a fraud.\n\nAdditionally, we emphasize that the usual crime-fraud scenario is one in which the attorney and client play distinct roles in their relationship. As Respondents contend, the only actors here are in-house counsel who communicated with and advised one another. So the District Court did not clearly err in determining that \"the attorneys here did more than opine on the lawfulness of the conduct.\" App. 183. Rather, it correctly recognized that the \"distinction between attorney and client is conflated in this case.\" App. 184.\n\nPetitioners take issue with the District Court's characterizing the \"legal analyses by in-house or outside counsel of the merits of potential claims against Perrigo and defenses Perrigo might raise\" as being 'in furtherance of' fraud. Pet. at 28-29. They also disagree with the District Court's legal conclusion that emails from in-house counsel discussing (1) Perrigo's certification that the '894 patent was not invalid or infringed and (2) an assessment regarding whether they could assert the patent against Perrigo were 'in furtherance of' fraud. The District Court highlighted that \"a number of the documents reveal that the attorneys doubted the merits of the action against Perrigo,\" such as a document that relied on the doctrine of equivalents, which the District Court had previously found to be \"objectively baseless.\" App. 188-89. Further, \"[i]n other documents, the attorneys delve[d] extensively into their concerns that the lawsuit against Perrigo would result in sanctions under Rule 11.\" App. 190 (citing Exs. 24, 29, 30, 31, 32, 66, 160). And the District Court noted that \"[t]he attorneys feared that they did not have viable arguments under the disclosure-dedication doctrine.\" Id. Together, these legal analyses and emails demonstrate how in-house counsel developed the sham litigation.\n\nPetitioners also argue that \"the privilege is lost only as to communications advising how to commit or conceal a fraud.\" Pet. at 27. Yet our case law does not impose such a limitation. We have recognized that \"[a]ll that is necessary [to trigger the crime-fraud exception] is that the client misuse or intend to misuse the attorney's advice in furtherance of an improper purpose.\" In re Grand Jury, 705 F.3d at 157. Moreover, we agree with Respondents, that a reasonable factfinder could determine, based on the documents discussed above, that in-house counsel, in planning to quickly pay Perrigo to settle, were advising themselves on how to commit a wrongdoing by engaging in sham litigation.\n\nb.\u2003A Post-Judgment Appeal is Adequate and Available\n\n\"To prevail on the merits of a mandamus petition, [Petitioners] must show \u2024 that no other adequate alternative remedy exists.\" In re Citizens Bank, N.A., 15 F.4th 607, 616 (3d Cir. 2021) (internal citation omitted). They have failed to make such a showing.\n\nThe Supreme Court concluded in Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter that \"postjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the rights of litigants and ensure the vitality of the attorney-client privilege.\" 558 U.S. 100, 109, 130 S.Ct. 599, 175 L.Ed.2d 458 (2009). That is so because \"[a]ppellate courts can remedy the improper disclosure of privileged material in the same way they remedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by vacating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new trial in which the protected material and its fruits are excluded from evidence.\" Id. Respondents apply \"Mohawk's logic\" to support their contention that Petitioners cannot obtain mandamus relief unless they show \"why, under the facts of this case, a post-judgment appeal is inadequate.\" Answer at 30. We conclude that Petitioners have failed to show why a post-judgment appeal is insufficient to protect their rights under the facts here.\n\nPetitioners argue that \"disobeying the orders and accepting sanctions is inadequate because that could trigger a form of sanction that is onerous but not immediately appealable.\" Pet. at 31 (internal citations omitted). But they fail to recognize another path that, though burdensome, would allow for immediate appeal: disobeying a court order, being held in contempt, and then appealing the contempt order. In re Search of Elec. Commc'n's in the Acct. of chakafattah@gmail.com at Internet Serv. Provider Google, Inc., 802 F.3d 516, 526 (3d Cir. 2015); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 70. Here, Petitioners could refuse to disclose the nineteen documents at issue and face sanctions such that a contempt proceeding could be initiated to ultimately provide the judicial review they seek. By failing to consider that option, at least in this instance, they have failed to show that no adequate alternative remedy exists.\n\nc.\u2003Petitioners Fail to Show Irreparable Injury\n\n\"Mandamus also requires a showing of irreparable injury,\" In re Citizens Bank, 15 F.4th at 616 n.8, yet Petitioners have not demonstrated how the documents at issue in this case, in being disclosed, would irreparably harm them. As Respondents emphasize, the documents, which now are more than a decade old, relate to an expired patent. Several of Petitioners' declarants are no longer employed by Petitioners. Further, \"protective orders are available to limit the spillover effects of disclosing sensitive information.\" Mohawk, 558 U.S. at 112, 130 S.Ct. 599. The parties agreed to a protective order ensuring that the documents at issue could be used only in connection with this litigation and could not be publicly disclosed. That protective order, as Respondents contend, refutes Petitioners' argument that the orders compelling document production \"threaten[\u2009] to expose the losing side in any litigation at all to invasive and unwarranted discovery.\" Pet. at 32.\n\nVII.\u2003Conclusion\n\nBecause Petitioners fail to show (1) a clear and indisputable abuse of discretion or error of law; (2) a lack of an alternate avenue for adequate relief; and (3) a likelihood of irreparable injury, we will deny the petition for a writ of mandamus.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n1. \u2003Abbvie Inc.; Abbvie Products LLC; and Unimed Pharmaceuticals, LLC are collectively referred to as \"Abbvie.\" As explained in Petitioners' corporate disclosure statement: \"Neither Abbott Laboratories nor AbbVie Inc. has any parent corporation. Unimed Pharmaceuticals LLC is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie Products LLC, which is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie Inc. Besins Healthcare, Inc. (\"BHI\") is a wholly owned subsidiary of Besins Healthcare Ireland Ltd.\" Pet. at i.\n\n2. \u2003\"AbbVie acquired Unimed's interest in the patent as follows: in 1999, Unimed was acquired by Solvay; in 2010, Solvay was acquired by Abbott; in 2013, Abbott separated into two companies -- Abbott and AbbVie -- with AbbVie assuming all of Abbott's propriet[ar]y pharmaceutical business, including its interest in Androgel.\" FTC II, 976 F.3d at 341.\n\n3. \u2003The parties proceeded to discovery, and one of the issues that remained was whether Petitioners' subjective motivation for filing suit was for an improper purpose.\n\n4. \u2003Under the crime-fraud exception, communications made between an attorney and client that are \"in furtherance of future illegal conduct\" are not protected by attorney-client privilege. United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 556, 109 S.Ct. 2619, 105 L.Ed.2d 469 (1989); see Haines v. Liggett Grp. Inc., 975 F.2d 81, 90 (3d Cir. 1992).\n\n5. \u200328 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) dictates in relevant part:When a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under this section, shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in such order.\n\n6. \u2003In the District Court's March 27, 2023 order, Judge Bartle determined that the filing of an action \"held to be a sham is encompassed within the definition of a fraud under the crime-fraud exception.\" App. 13-14. He also recognized that \"it is not necessary to decide whether the filing of a sham litigation in this Circuit is a common law fraud on the court\" because \"reliance[,] while an essential element of common law fraud[,] is not an essential element of fraud for purposes of the crime-fraud exception in the Third Circuit.\" App. 8-9.Petitioners also complain that the District Court \"rejected the Federal Circuit's conclusion, made in patent cases, that no fraud exists under the [crime-fraud] exception without\" misrepresentation of fact or reliance on such a misrepresentation, Pet. at 9-10. But the District Court appropriately applied Third Circuit law because \"[t]he Federal Circuit does not have jurisdiction over any appeal in this action.\" App. 12.\n\n7. \u2003Some scholarly sources indicate that the first reported case involving a writ of mandamus arose in 1573 in Middleton's Case, 3 Dyer 332b (1573). See, e.g., Leonard Goodman, Mandamus in the Colonies-The Rise of the Superintending Power of American Courts, The Am. J. of Legal Hist. Vol. I, 4 at 309 (Oct. 1957). The King's Bench issued its more foundational mandamus case in 1615. See id. (discussing James Bagg's Case, 11 Coke's Rep. 93 at 98 (1615)).\n\n8. \u2003Out-of-Circuit cases also support the conclusion that sham litigation triggers the crime-fraud exception. See, e.g., United States v. Richard Roe, Inc., 168 F.3d 69, 72 (2d Cir. 1999) (holding that \"bringing baseless litigation intended to delay entry into a market by a competitor\" may \"after a rigorous in camera review by a court for relevance, fall within the crime-fraud exception\"); Chandler v. Phoenix Servs., No. 7:19-cv-00014-O, 2020 WL 487503, at*5 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 30, 2020) (\"Thus, the crime-fraud exception applies to all attorney-client communications and work product made in furtherance of the Phoenix Defendants' assertion of the '993 Patent through the alleged sham patent litigation.\"); Peerless Indus., Inc. v. Crimson AV LLC, No. 11 C 1768, 2013 WL 6050006, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 14, 2013) (\"Fraud consisting of the knowing pursuit of baseless litigation may bring the crime-fraud exception into play.\") (quoting Motorola, Inc. v. Vosi Techs., Inc., No. 01 C 4182, 2002 WL 1917256, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 19, 2002)).\n\n9. \u2003Petitioners, citing out-of-Circuit precedent, argue that mandamus relief may be appropriate in the absence of a clear error, when a case involves \"an issue important to 'proper judicial administration,'\u2009\" In re Gonzales, 623 F.3d 1242, 1246-47 (9th Cir. 2010), rev'd on other grounds, 568 U.S. 57, 133 S.Ct. 696, 184 L.Ed.2d 528 (2013) (internal citation omitted), or a \"legal question of first impression or of extraordinary significance,\" In re von Bulow, 828 F.2d 94, 97-98 (2d Cir. 1987). We have previously recognized a \"line of cases recognizing that mandamus may properly be used as a means of immediate appellate review of orders compelling the production of documents claimed to be protected by privilege.\" Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 738 F.2d 587, 591, 596 (3d Cir. 1984). There, we considered a disclosure order with \"no adequate, alternative procedure for review,\" and recognized that, in such an instance, we \"may\" consider the claimed privilege by exercising our mandamus power. Id. at 591. But even where we considered the merits of a work-product doctrine issue and remanded \"without formal issuance of the writ of mandamus,\" we \"caution[ed] that mandamus is not to be used as an ordinary vehicle to obtain interlocutory relief from discovery orders.\" Id. Its availability is limited to \"prevent[ing] grave injustice.\" Id.Under our precedent, while the legal issues a petition for mandamus presents may inform whether we exercise our discretion to grant mandamus even if Petitioners cannot make the three-pronged showing discussed above, see, e.g., In re McGraw-Hill Glob. Educ. Holdings, LLC, 909 F.3d at 57, we do not find it necessary to exercise such discretion here. At its core, our precedent dictates that mandamus should not \"become a means\" for \"all potentially erroneous orders,\" to be corrected. Id. (internal citation omitted). And our case law has repeatedly emphasized that \"errors of law must at least approach[\u2009] the magnitude of an unauthorized exercise of judicial power, or a failure to use that power when there is a duty to do so.\" Id. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). There has been no unauthorized exercise of judicial power here.\n\n10. \u2003We have recognized that Rule 11 aims \"to discourage pleadings that are 'frivolous, legally unreasonable, or without factual foundation, even though the paper was not filed in subjective bad faith.'\u2009\" Lieb v. Topstone Indus., Inc., 788 F.2d 151, 157 (3d Cir. 1986) (internal citation omitted).\n\n11. \u2003Petitioners concede that \"[t]his Court has not \u2024 ruled on that [reliance] issue.\" Pet. at 23. Thus, as Petitioners recognize, there is no binding precedent supporting their argument. Mandamus relief is therefore inappropriate.\n\n12. \u2003Petitioners have not challenged the District Court's factual findings as clearly erroneous. As an appellate court, we must show \"great deference\" to the District Court, United States v. Antoon, 933 F.2d 200, 204 (3d Cir. 1991), and \"accept the factual determination of the fact finder unless that determination 'either (1) is completely devoid of minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of credibility, or (2) bears no rational relationship to the supportive evidentiary data.'\u2009\" Haines, 975 F.2d at 92 (internal citations omitted).\n\n13. \u2003In In re Grand Jury Subpoena, we considered whether the crime-fraud exception applied to the testimony of an attorney whose corporate client approached him with questions regarding obtaining financing from a bank for a particular project. 745 F.3d at 685. The client told his attorney that the official overseeing the project's financing had threatened to slow the process for approving it. Id. Hoping to facilitate approval, the client told his attorney he planned to make a payment to the official. Id. After conducting preliminary research and reviewing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), the attorney asked the client whether the financial institution was a government entity or if the official at issue worked for the government. Id. Further, the attorney advised the client not to make any payment to the official. Id. At that point, having conducted only limited research, the attorney had not determined whether paying the bank official would be illegal. Id. The client did not heed his attorney's advice. Id. Instead, the client conveyed that he would make the payment, insisting there would be no FCPA violation. Id. The client and attorney then terminated their relationship. Id. The client later made payments of more than $3.5 million over a two-year span to the bank official's sister, a person not affiliated with the financial institution. Id.We recognized in that case that the attorney's questions concerning possible government affiliation would have indicated to the client \"that the governmental connection was key to violating the FCPA.\" Id. at 693. Awareness of that connection \"would lead logically\" to the client's attempting \"to avoid the reaches of the FCPA or detection of [an FCPA] violation\" by making payments to the bank official's sister rather than to the banker himself. Id.\n\n14. \u2003In reaching this conclusion, the District Court did not rely on \"after the fact\" evidence, as Petitioners suggest. The Documents preceded the filing of the Perrigo Lawsuit, and the District Court pointed to the fact that in-house counsel's internal settlement discussions \"began over 15 days before the infringement action against Perrigo was filed.\" App. 187.\n\n15. \u2003Under the doctrine of equivalents \"a product or process that does not literally infringe upon the express terms of a patent claim may nonetheless be found to infringe if there is 'equivalence' between the elements of the accused product or process and the claimed elements of the patented invention.\" Warner-Jenkinson Co., Inc. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., 520 U.S. 17, 21, 117 S.Ct. 1040, 137 L.Ed.2d 146 (1997) (internal citation omitted).\n\n16. \u2003Under the disclosure-dedication doctrine, \"when a patent drafter discloses but declines to claim subject matter, \u2024 this action dedicates the unclaimed subject matter to the public.\" Eagle Pharm. Inc. v. Slayback Pharma LLC, 958 F.3d 1171, 1175 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (quoting Johnson & Johnston Assoc. v. R.E. Servs., 285 F.3d 1046, 1054 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (en banc)). This doctrine thus \"bars application of the doctrine of equivalents.\" Id.\n\n17. \u2003We do not suggest that provoking a finding of contempt is necessary in every case for mandamus relief to be available. We simply note that it is one way to obtain judicial review.",

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD) is a Trending Stock",
        "body": "Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this provider of midstream energy services have returned +5.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB industry, which Enterprise Products falls in, has gained 6.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Enterprise Products is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.76 indicates a change of +4.9% from what Enterprise Products is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Enterprise Products is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Enterprise Products, the consensus sales estimate of $13.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.5%. The $53.6 billion and $57.46 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.8% and +7.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nEnterprise Products reported revenues of $14.62 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.1%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.65 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +14.64%. The EPS surprise was +9.09%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Enterprise Products surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nEnterprise Products is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Enterprise Products. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nGlobal demand for oil is through the roof... and oil producers are struggling to keep up. So even though oil prices are well off their recent highs, you can expect big profits from the companies that supply the world with \"black gold.\"\n\nZacks Investment Research has just released an urgent special report to help you bank on this trend.\n\nIn Oil Market on Fire, you'll discover 4 unexpected oil and gas stocks positioned for big gains in the coming weeks and months.

        "title": "Is Enterprise Products Partners the Best Dividend Stock for You?",
        "body": "What makes an outstanding dividend stock? It's probably a dividend that gives investors a solid starting yield. You'll want to trust the company to pay it and, ideally, grow the dividend payment over time. It can be hard to check all these boxes.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) could be up to the task. The oil and gas master limited partnership (MLP) boasts a 7.2% starting yield and has increased its distribution (dividend in MLP terms) for 25 consecutive years.\n\nWill that continue? Enterprise Products Partners could be the right dividend stock for you. Here's why.\n\nWhat is a master limited partnership?\n\nMaster limited partnerships (MLPs) are a neat business model. They are publicly traded partnerships, which give investors some tax advantages compared to a traditional corporation while still maintaining the ability to buy and sell on the stock market easily. An MLP is a pass-through entity, meaning the partnership doesn't pay corporate taxes; unit holders (you) report the partnership's profits or losses instead. When you file your taxes, you do so with a form called a Schedule K-1.\n\nThe tax benefit of investing in MLPs is that you avoid double taxation. A dividend is technically taxed twice: Once because the corporation pays the dividend out of its taxed profits, and again when shareholders file their taxes.\n\nTo qualify for their tax exemption, MLPs must also derive at least 90% of their income from the exploration, production, and transportation of natural resources or real estate. That means most MLPs are energy companies like Enterprise Products Partners.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners is a blue chip MLP\n\nAs far as MLPs go, Enterprise Products Partners is a good one. The company operates a network of pipelines that span the United States, transporting oil, gas, and refined products throughout the country. A midstream like Enterprise Products Partners is similar to a toll booth in the energy industry, collecting fees on the materials passing through its pipelines.\n\nToday, business is excellent for midstream companies like Enterprise Products Partners. The United States is producing fossil fuels at historically high levels, and those fuels must be transported to various places, such as refineries and exports.\n\nFinancially, Enterprise Products Partners is rock-solid. The company has paid and raised its distribution for 25 consecutive years, enduring recessions and the energy industry's up-and-down cycles. It maintains an investment-grade credit rating from Moody's and S&P Global, and the distribution is just 56% of its cash flows.\n\nIf you want passive income, Enterprise Products Partners can deliver it. High yields are sometimes a warning sign because the market might be skeptical that the company can afford the payout. Not so here. You can hold this MLP and sleep well at night.\n\nShould investors buy today?\n\nValuing a midstream company involves comparing the amount investors pay for the company's assets after subtracting debt, known as book value, to the business's profitability. I've charted both below to do this.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners has averaged a 4.1 price-to-book value ratio (P/B ratio) over the past decade. Today, it trades below that at 3.4 times book value. Yet the company is generating over 16% returns on its invested capital, the highest in a decade. Based on this, one could argue that Enterprise Products Partners is very attractive at its current price -- a strong buy today. You're paying less for better business performance.\n\nInvestors have a shot at nearly 20% returns in price appreciation if the stock were to track back to its long-term average P/B ratio. Then, factor in the 7.2% starting distribution yield. Enterprise Products Partners is a fantastic dividend (distribution) stock today -- and a potential market-beating investment if shares get hot.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Enterprise Products Partners wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nJustin Pope has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "title": "We're integrating AI in all our new database solutions: Oracle's Ashish Ray",
        "body": "American technology company Oracle is foundational to enterprise digital transformation. Its database technologies have powered some of the world's most demanding business-critical applications for over four decades. With artificial intelligence (AI) emerging as a transformational force today, Oracle said, it will continue to deliver the infrastructure required to extract the full value from AI technologies.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCircle, Ashish Ray, vice president, product management for Exadata, Oracle Autonomous Database, database cloud and high-availability computing, Oracles, emphasizes the importance of a multi-cloud approach, as it enables enterprises to avoid dependence on a single cloud provider. By distributing assets, data, and services across multiple providers, scalability and efficiency are improved, while risks associated with relying solely on one provider are mitigated.\n\nIn line with this strategy, he said, Oracle is collaborating closely with Microsoft Azure to achieve seamless integration. Through the integration of Microsoft Azure regions and OCI regions at the backend, Oracle databases can now be deployed on Exadata using enterprise capabilities like real application clusters or rack insight directly in Azure.\n\n\"This integration benefits end users who are already utilising Azure for their business applications, as they can now leverage Oracle databases on Exadata without the need for multiple hops through different cloud providers,\" said Ray.\n\nJust last week, Oracle expanded its collaboration with Microsoft to meet the growing demand for Oracle Database@Azure on a global scale. To cater to enterprise customers, Oracle's cloud application will now be accessible in five additional regions, bringing the total to 15 regions worldwide, including India. This expansion allows businesses using the Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Suite to utilise the new generative AI capabilities, enhancing both employee and customer experiences.\n\nRay added that the goal is to ensure a seamless and transparent end user experience by handling all the necessary backend integration work. \"We will continue to invest and collaborate further with Azure to enhance this technology. Currently, our solution supports accelerated database service, and we anticipate autonomous database support to be available in the near future,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, Oracle announced the general availability of its Oracle Database 23c long-term support release in October. \"We believe that these advancements will greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of businesses,\" Ray said. It will eliminate a significant amount of manual error-related work that is currently being done. It will also eliminate many tedious and burdensome tasks that businesses currently spend a lot of time and effort on. Overall, it will bring greater agility to businesses, making them more productive. This is certainly very appealing to CIOs.\n\nThe technology giant is also heavily investing in engineering innovation in the field of Gen AI. As Ray mentioned, within the Oracle database, they are developing Gen AI vector search, which means that they are integrating Gen AI vector database capabilities directly into the database.\n\n\"From an end user perspective, this means that Oracle database customers with terabytes and petabytes of data already stored in the Oracle database can benefit from Gen AI without having to acquire a completely different technology and go through the integration challenges of incorporating it into their existing environment. This area has generated a lot of interest and attention from customers,\" he explained.\n\nThe company is also looking at integrating JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) processing with relational database processing. JSON is text-based technology and is an easier yet structured way of transmitting data. \"With this architectural innovation, customers don't have to compromise. They can still enjoy the benefits of relational database management while adopting newer technologies such as JSON without changing any applications,\" said Ray.\n\nThe other area Oracle is focusing on is Exadata. Along with the Oracle database, 23C, it is working on the next generation of Exadata architecture called Exadata Exascale, Ray mentioned. This new architecture aims to bring in all the inherent accelerator storage smartness in a cloud storage manner. It is completely flexible, scalable, and elastic while retaining all the Exadata smart features that customers have traditionally used, such as smart scan and storage index, said Ray.\n\nIt goes without saying that Cloud products and services make up a significant portion of Oracle's revenue. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, cloud services and licenses generated $32.39 billion in revenue, accounting for 83% of the company's total revenue for the quarter.",

Meanwhile, two other large for-profit health systems -- Franklin, Tenn.-based Community Health Systems and Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare -- have trimmed the number of hospitals they operated over that span.\n\nThose trajectories could continue in 2024. HCA closed its acquisition of Trinity Regional Hospital Sachse (Texas) from Sunland Medical Foundation on Feb. 1. That same day, Tenet completed the sale of three South Carolina hospitals to Winston-Salem, N.C.-based Novant Health and reached a definitive agreement to sell four hospitals in Southern California and their associated outpatient locations to Orange, Calif.-based UCI Health. On Feb. 29, Tenet announced it signed a definitive agreement to sell two more California hospitals to Roseville, Calif.-based Adventist Health.\n\nCHS CEO Tim Hingtgen said during the company's Feb. 21 earnings call that it is evaluating interest for sales that could yield more than $1 billion in additional proceeds. CFO Kevin Hammons said on the call that the system anticipates one or more of these transactions could close within the calendar year. The system also has plans to sell two of its North Carolina hospitals to Novant Health, but the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the move in January. The case is pending in federal court.\n\nHere is how the number of hospitals the three for-profit systems have operated have grown or shrunk over the past five years, according to regulatory filings. The figures are as of Dec. 31 of those years.",

        "body": "Rendering of upcoming convenience store. Image courtesy of Elite Studio E.\n\nOne of Milwaukee's largest companies is bringing a convenience store to its downtown campus. Northwestern Mutual on Thursday morning announced its plans to open a retail store in the base of its 32-story tower offering meals, snacks and other essentials for both office workers and the general public.\n\nThe 4,090-square-foot store is slated to open in late fall 2024 on the first floor of the company's Commons building, with a public entrance at 805 E. Mason St. The Starbucks cafe within the building will be relocated to a more public-facing location.\n\nThe addition is a result of popular demand by company employees, who have been without a convenient stop for food and beverage since the 2020 closure of Maurer's Urban Market grocery store.\n\nThe previous store opened in 2019 on the first floor of Northwestern Mutual's 7Seventy7 apartment tower at the intersection of N. Van Buren and E. Mason streets. The space is now home to fine-dining restaurant Lupi & Iris, as well as its sister cafe, Andiamo. The coffee shop features a small retail section offering grab-and-go meals, frozen pizzas and more.\n\nTodd Smasal, vice president of total rewards and campus experience for Northwestern Mutual, said the new store will be a welcome addition to Downtown, noting that the company is eager to fulfill the needs of its employees and others in the community.\n\n\"We consistently listen to the needs of our employees and additional convenience is important to managing their employee experience,\" he said in a statement. \"We look forward to bringing this vision to life over the coming months.\"\n\nSimilar to Maurer's, the upcoming store plans to sell \"a wide range of products\" including snacks, grab-and-go food items, beverages, household items and gifts. It will also contain a beverage bar offering juice, smoothies and coffee; a hot bar offering soup and sandwiches; and a bakery counter.\n\nThe store's anticipated hours of operation are Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe company is also reshuffling some of its other on-campus amenities.\n\nLater this year, the Northwestern Mutual Credit Union will move west within the Commons. When that move is complete, the existing Starbucks will take its place on the corner of E. Mason Street and N. Prospect Avenue, creating a bigger footprint for the coffee shop while allowing space for a public entrance and outdoor patio. The cafe shift is expected to take place in 2025.\n\nThe updates come as Northwestern Mutual continues to overhaul its 19-story North Building as part of a $500 million plan to improve and expand its downtown campus.

        "title": "Google, Microsoft and Nucor team up on clean energy development : Energy & Environment",
        "body": "North American steel manufacturer Nucor Corporation and US tech giants Google and Microsoft Corporation are to work together across the electricity ecosystem to develop new business models and aggregate their demand for advanced clean electricity technologies, including advanced nuclear.\n\nThese models, they say, will be designed to accelerate the development of first-of-a-kind and early commercial projects, including advanced nuclear, next-generation geothermal, clean hydrogen, long-duration energy storage and others.\n\nAs a first step, the companies will issue a Request for Information in several US regions for potential projects in need of offtake, and encourage technology providers, developers, investors, utilities and others to get involved.\n\nBy developing new commercial structures and aggregating demand from three of the world's largest energy buyers, this approach aims to reduce the risks for utilities and developers considering early commercial projects and enable the investments that are needed - ultimately helping to bring these projects online by the early 2030s and reducing technology costs through repeated deployment.\n\nThe companies will initially focus on proving out the demand aggregation and procurement model through advanced technology pilot projects in the USA. The companies will pilot a project delivery framework focused on three enabling levers for early commercial projects: signing offtake agreements for technologies that are still early on the cost curve; bringing a clear customer voice to policymakers and other stakeholders on broader long-term ecosystem improvements; and developing new enabling tariff structures in partnership with energy providers and utilities.\n\nIn addition to supporting innovative technologies that can help decarbonise electricity systems worldwide, the partners say this demand aggregation model will bring clear benefits to large energy buyers. Pooling demand enables buyers to offtake larger volumes of carbon-free electricity from a portfolio of plants, reducing project-specific development risk, and enables procurement efficiencies and shared learnings.\n\nTo ensure that the project delivery framework that they develop is transparent and scalable, Google, Microsoft and Nucor will share their lessons learned and the roadmap from their first pilot projects, and encourage other companies to consider how they can also support advanced clean electricity projects.\n\nIn May last year, Nucor signed a memorandum of understanding with NuScale Power to explore the deployment of NuScale's VOYGR small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) power plants at Nucor's scrap-based Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steel mills. In addition, NuScale is studying the feasibility of siting a manufacturing facility for NuScale Power Modules near a Nucor facility. In April 2022, Nucor - with operating facilities in the USA, Canada and Mexico - committed to a USD15 million private investment in public equity in NuScale Power.\n\nIn 2022, Constellation Energy announced it was collaborating with Microsoft on the development of an energy matching technology using real-time, data-driven carbon accounting solution and hour-by-hour regional tracking to match customer needs with local carbon-free energy sources. Last year, Microsoft agreed a new hourly energy-matching agreement with Constellation that harnesses the environmental attributes of nuclear to put the data centre in Boydton, Virginia \"very close\" to the goal of 100% carbon-free operation.\n\nMicrosoft has also signed an agreement with fusion energy developer Helion Energy for the provision of electricity from its first fusion power plant.",

        "title": "Google, Microsoft and Nucor team up on clean energy development",
        "body": "North American steel manufacturer Nucor Corporation and US tech giants Google and Microsoft Corporation are to work together across the electricity ecosystem to develop new business models and aggregate their demand for advanced clean electricity technologies, including advanced nuclear.\n\nThese models, they say, will be designed to accelerate the development of first-of-a-kind and early commercial projects, including advanced nuclear, next-generation geothermal, clean hydrogen, long-duration energy storage and others.\n\nAs a first step, the companies will issue a Request for Information in several US regions for potential projects in need of offtake, and encourage technology providers, developers, investors, utilities and others to get involved.\n\nBy developing new commercial structures and aggregating demand from three of the world's largest energy buyers, this approach aims to reduce the risks for utilities and developers considering early commercial projects and enable the investments that are needed - ultimately helping to bring these projects online by the early 2030s and reducing technology costs through repeated deployment.\n\nThe companies will initially focus on proving out the demand aggregation and procurement model through advanced technology pilot projects in the USA. The companies will pilot a project delivery framework focused on three enabling levers for early commercial projects: signing offtake agreements for technologies that are still early on the cost curve; bringing a clear customer voice to policymakers and other stakeholders on broader long-term ecosystem improvements; and developing new enabling tariff structures in partnership with energy providers and utilities.\n\nIn addition to supporting innovative technologies that can help decarbonise electricity systems worldwide, the partners say this demand aggregation model will bring clear benefits to large energy buyers. Pooling demand enables buyers to offtake larger volumes of carbon-free electricity from a portfolio of plants, reducing project-specific development risk, and enables procurement efficiencies and shared learnings.\n\nTo ensure that the project delivery framework that they develop is transparent and scalable, Google, Microsoft and Nucor will share their lessons learned and the roadmap from their first pilot projects, and encourage other companies to consider how they can also support advanced clean electricity projects.\n\nIn May last year, Nucor signed a memorandum of understanding with NuScale Power to explore the deployment of NuScale's VOYGR small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) power plants at Nucor's scrap-based Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steel mills. In addition, NuScale is studying the feasibility of siting a manufacturing facility for NuScale Power Modules near a Nucor facility. In April 2022, Nucor - with operating facilities in the USA, Canada and Mexico - committed to a USD15 million private investment in public equity in NuScale Power.\n\nIn 2022, Constellation Energy announced it was collaborating with Microsoft on the development of an energy matching technology using real-time, data-driven carbon accounting solution and hour-by-hour regional tracking to match customer needs with local carbon-free energy sources. Last year, Microsoft agreed a new hourly energy-matching agreement with Constellation that harnesses the environmental attributes of nuclear to put the data centre in Boydton, Virginia \"very close\" to the goal of 100% carbon-free operation.\n\nMicrosoft has also signed an agreement with fusion energy developer Helion Energy for the provision of electricity from its first fusion power plant.",

        "body": "Exelon Corp. is a leading pure-play energy provider, with transmission and distribution operations in the U.S. and headquarters in Chicago. Exelon spun off its generation business, which was about 60% nuclear, as Constellation Energy at the end of 2021. Constellation is now a publicly traded company focused on generation and competitive distribution, while Exelon focuses on regulated transmission and distribution. In conjunction with the February 2022 Constellation spinoff, EXC shareholders received one share of CEG for every three shares of EXC. Exelon shares were repriced as a result of this separation. Through its regulated utility subsidiaries, Exelon delivers electricity and natural gas to about 10 million customers, primarily in central Maryland (Baltimore Gas & Electric Co.), northern Illinois (ComEd), and southeastern Pennsylvania (PECO). ComEd accounted for about 36% of total 2023 revenue while PHI accounted for 28%. The company plans to cut emissions by 50% by 2030 and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The shares are a component of the S&P 500. The market cap is about $36 billion.",

        "body": "On Wednesday, Argus sustained its positive stance on Exelon Corporation (NYSE:NASDAQ:EXC), a company serving approximately 10 million customers with electricity and natural gas across several U.S. states. The firm reiterated its Buy rating and a stock price target of $45.00, reflecting confidence in the company's strategic shift towards becoming a pure-play transmission utility following the spinoff of its competitive energy business.\n\nThe transformation is seen as a move that will enable Exelon to better manage costs and potentially benefit from the anticipated moderate wholesale energy prices in 2024. The company's management has forecasted a long-term earnings growth rate of 6%-8% for its utilities, a target that Argus believes is well within reach.\n\nThe analyst firm also highlighted Exelon's recent favorable rate case decisions as a contributing factor to its optimistic outlook. These decisions are expected to support the company's financial performance moving forward. Moreover, Exelon's commitment to a cleaner transmission mix, with a particular focus on hydropower, was noted as a positive aspect of its operations.\n\nExelon's customer base spans across Illinois, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and the District of Columbia. The company's pivot away from generating operations to focus on transmission is seen as a strategic move that could lead to more predictable and stable financial outcomes.\n\nThe reaffirmed Buy rating and stock price target by Argus indicate a continued endorsement of Exelon's business strategy and growth potential in the utility sector.",
